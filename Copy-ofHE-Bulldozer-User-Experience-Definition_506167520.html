This is from the student's point of view, at approx eye level, lasting no more than a few seconds to help orient the learner to the simulation environment. </p><p>The voiceover will welcome the student and advise them to follow the prompts to practice a walk-around inspection of the bulldozer.  Students will be prompted to observe each inspectable item in order. </p><h2 id="CopyofHE-BulldozerUserExperienceDefinition-CameraBehaviourandNavigation"><span data-colorid="ul5xc2yeve">Camera Behaviour and Navigation</span></h2><p>The HE-Bulldozer simulation will primarily be a Guided Mode style of learner interaction, where the camera will move automatically for each inspection, there will be no need for the learner to navigate manually using either keyboard or mouse.  The Guided Mode inspection walks the student through the inspection process so that the student does not decide what to inspect or in what order.  For certain views, we will consider the optional use of camera pan and zoom, but the objective will always be to ensure that the learner can see whatever they need to inspect without fiddling around with the camera.</p><h2 id="CopyofHE-BulldozerUserExperienceDefinition-InteractionModel"><span data-colorid="s7bzl5ugvp">Interaction Model</span></h2><p>TBD - With the inclusion of multi-media visual experiences for the learner, it is unclear if our traditional user interaction for inspections will be appropriate.</p><p>Traditionally, we have shown the user a visual representation (a 3D model) of the inspectable component, and asked them to determine if the component was good or bad (and to specify the type of &ldquo;bad&rdquo; state shown).  This method requires intricately detailed models, sometimes involving several different models of the exact same component to represent the good and bad states.  Damages had to sometimes be exaggerated, even to an unrealistic extent, in order to be reasonably noticeable to the learner.</p><p>In this new mixed-media simulation, we might consider a totally different approach to teaching the pre-op inspection process, with a more comprehensive view.  For example, we could consider the popularity of the Results Panel design that was used for Trucking Pre-Trip Inspection.  That panel shows the GOOD state of the selected component as well as ALL OF THE BAD STATES.  This helps the learner to identify the key differences between the good and bad states for the selected inspectable component, and can use photos, still shots captured from video footage, or even illustrations or diagrams to get the point across.</p><p>Another area for consideration is the learner feedback model for this inspection.  Our e-learning experts, Lisa and our other resources in eLC, can help direct us toward the most effective model for providing feedback and redirection for learners.</p><h2 id="CopyofHE-BulldozerUserExperienceDefinition-ProgressandFeedback"><span data-colorid="vq3f1bl3ml">Progress and Feedback</span></h2><p>We may consider reuse of the Progress Checklist and Results Panel that were used in the Trucking Pre-Trip Inspection simulation:</p><p><strong>Progress Checklist</strong> - The primary function of the Progress Checklist is to help the student identify what they have already completed in their inspection workflow, and what is left to be done. The Progress Checklist does not indicate if answers are correct or incorrect, and does not need to provide any details about what damages have been reported.  The student is free to revisit any part of the inspection at any time, so they can review/change their answers by simply revisiting a POI.</p><p><strong>Results Panel</strong> - Sometimes the inspection workflow does not provide any immediate feedback to the learner about their selected answer for any of the inspection tasks, so the Results Panel is the primary way for the learner to see their results. Other times, feedback is provided in real time and the Results Panel is a summary view of all feedback up to this point.  On demand (usually a menu button), the student will be shown a complete list of every inspection task (these may be organized in a familiar way that is consistent with the Progress Checklist, to help the student find what they are looking for) where each task will be given one of THREE results:</p><ul><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="suiewb51jo">Green checkmark</span></strong> - This task was completed successfully. The selected answer is the correct answer.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="aaqcbvi3p7">Red X</span></strong><span data-colorid="jtbbyxuy1k"> </span>- This task was completed, but the answer selected was incorrect. The correct answer will be provided at this time.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="uabw07kr2x">Incomplete</span></strong> - This result will be assigned to any inspection POI that was NOT VISITED by the student.  This is an important distinction because we want the student to get a different result when they missed/forgot a step in the inspection, even if there was no damage present at that POI in this case.</p></li></ul><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-warning confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>EVERYTHING BELOW THIS POINT ON THE PAGE IS JUST COPIED FROM TRUCKING UX DEFINITION</p><p>This section of the page will be completed once we have made some fundamental decisions about user workflow and feedback.</p></div></div><h2 id="CopyofHE-BulldozerUserExperienceDefinition-Position#1-DriversSideFront1(DSF1)">Position #1 - Drivers Side Front 1 (DSF1)</h2><p>The camera will stop at the front driver's side corner of the vehicle, angled so that the camera is looking at most of the front and driver's side of the truck.&nbsp; This will be called Position DSF.

The camera will follow as the student climbs the steps outside the driver&rsquo;s side door, the door will swing automatically open and the camera will pan briefly and smoothly across the forward cab (there is no need to explore the sleeper cabin, it is just in the background). This cinematic view of the interior should take no longer than 2-3 seconds, and is intended to give a quick overview of the cab interior before focusing in on the first inspection task.  The camera will stop with a driver&rsquo;s POV as if sitting in the driver&rsquo;s seat, looking out the front windshield.  The voiceover will prompt the student to complete tasks in the immediate area of this position.</p><ol><li><p>Parking brakes  (always works) - PHYSICAL INSPECTION. Note that this is not an inspection task, but is required to proceed with the inspection. The parking brake controls are two large plastic buttons on the dashboard. The colour and shape of these buttons are standardized for all trucks, so it is important that model exactly match the reference photos (see Inspection 15 for a good front view).  The student must verify that the brakes are applied by checking to ensure that BOTH buttons are pulled OUT fully.  The student <u>must not release the brakes</u> and reapply - they must verify that the brakes are applied.  If the either of the brakes are not applied (button is pushed in) they must pull the button to ensure the parking brake is applied before they proceed with the inspection.</p></li><li><p>Steering mechanism (excessive play) - PHYSICAL INSPECTION (student is prompted to click the steering wheel icon)  Animation shows the steering wheel turning easily a SHORT distance (approx 10cm or less) in each direction, indicating proper functioning of the steering mechanism.  Alternatively, the animation shows the steering wheel moving a LARGE distance (approx 20+cm or 1/4 the total circumference) easily with no resistance, indicating excessive &ldquo;play&rdquo; or &ldquo;lash&rdquo; that points to a serious maintenance issue with the steering mechanism.  This will be difficult to show clearly, so a toast/voiceover hint will help the student recognize when the steering is too loose, &ldquo;The steering wheel feels very loose, it can easily be turned more than 1/4 of the way in either direction without any resistance&rdquo; or &ldquo;The steering wheel can be turned only a little before encountering resistance&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Dashboard gauges (malfunctioning) - PHYSICAL INSPECTION (student is prompted to turn the key halfway without starting the engine) Turning the key halfway will initialize the dashboard instrument panel and cause all of the gauges to &ldquo;sweep&rdquo;.  Any gauge that does not move at all, has a missing needle, or is fluctuating wildly can be selected at this time and marked as malfunctioning.  Dashboard warning lights will all briefly light up (simultaneously, for about 1-2 seconds) and then go out.  The warning lights are not part of this stage of the inspection, but we will demonstrate the normal function of the dashboard so that students become familiar with this normal behaviour.</p></li><li><p>Activate Test Lights and Trailer Brake aka The Spike (always works)  - PHYSICAL INSPECTION - Note that this is not an inspection task, but is required to proceed with the exterior inspection. Voiceover will prompt the student to click on the Test Lights button and the Trailer Brake lever to activate the exterior lights. Note that the dashboard indicators will blink in time with the exterior lights, so this will be visible on the dashboard instrument panel.</p></li><li><p>Brake pedal (loss of brake pedal pressure) - PHYSICAL INSPECTION - The voiceover will prompt the student to put their foot on the brake pedal.  If the pedal offers no resistance and sinks easily right to the floor with a thump, there is a loss of brake pedal pressure.  When functioning correctly, the brake pedal should offer firm counterpressure when pressed, it should only go about 75% of the way to the floor.  Voiceover and toast messages may be used to help demonstrate the condition of the brake pedal, such as &ldquo;Whoa, this pedal feels really soft, there is hardly any resistance and it goes all the way to the floor&rdquo;.
