</div><p /><h2 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-WhatisaGameDesignDocument(GDD)?"><strong>What is a Game Design Document (GDD)?</strong></h2><p>This game design document is a <u>living document</u> which details the core design principles and decisions with regards to the development of the &ldquo;Supply Chain&rdquo; Digital Learning Experience (DLX). This document will be updated as development progresses, and provide links to further documentation under the appropriate section headings.</p><p /><hr /><h2 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-ChangeLog"><strong>Change Log</strong></h2><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Version0.1">Version 0.1</h3><p>This document was started on March 11, 2024.</p><p>Version 0.9</p><p>This document was properly filled out on March 28, 2024. Many elements remain unclear and others are just idea banks which is why this refrains from being a 1.0 release. References to a 2D top-down sim were changed to a 3D isometric sim. This was the final update written by Colm Ambler.</p><p /><hr /><h2 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-DLXOverview"><strong>DLX Overview</strong></h2><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-WhatistheDLX?">What is the DLX?</h3><p>Supply Chain is a top-down isometric management DLX. The learner takes control of an omnipotent being overviewing a supply chain in a warehouse over the course of an in-game day. The learner watches the schedules and mannerisms of each employee, making decisions that impacts the production line and it&rsquo;s efficiency. </p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Audience">Audience</h3><p>In the end, this DLX will be made for multiple programs. As such, this DLX will be made modularly so that it can branch out as needed. However, in the beginning it&rsquo;s being developed for one program in the student&rsquo;s final term.</p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-LearningObjectives">Learning Objectives</h3><p>The learner will:</p><ul><li><p>Understand the flow of a supply chain in a warehouse by following it in real-time.</p></li><li><p>See the intricate movements of employees in a warehouse in a 3D space.</p></li><li><p>Make adjustments to the factory and see the resulting changes.</p></li></ul><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Setting">Setting </h3><p>A small warehouse.</p><p><span data-colorid="aq0heip2fq">Things to be determined:</span></p><ul><li><p><span data-colorid="aa3hjlbtk0">Type of inventory</span></p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="l3qfx78wq4">Amount of Employees</span></p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="sg45gk1x4g">All necessary roles and locations</span></p></li></ul><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Tone">Tone</h3><p>The tone of the sim will be overall light-hearted. The dialogue will have a comedic undertone while also explaining the learning. There will be an AI companion (potentially named Vlados) that will offer comedic relief in their delivery. The tone needs to balance itself especially if different instructors will impact the preamble. </p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Genre">Genre</h3><p>This sim takes significant inspiration from top-down simulation games such as Rimworld or Prison Architect. Often a more challenging and stressful genre, Supply Chain will make things simpler by removing a lot of the micromanaging that comes with those types of games. It will have a cartoonish art style, beginning with simple 3D capsules to represent characters.</p><p /><hr /><h2 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Features"><strong>Features</strong></h2><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-GeneralFeatures">General Features</h3><ul><li><p>Flat screen simulation designed for knowledge reinforcement.</p></li><li><p>Character schedules influenced by factors such as personality and time of day.</p></li><li><p>Decision making points allowing the learner to see the results of their actions.</p></li><li><p>A grading system that highlights the importance of decision-making.</p></li><li><p>Showcase of multiple jobs in a warehouse.</p></li><li><p>Scalable design with additional jobs.</p></li><li><p>3D Isometric.</p></li><li><p>A close up view, either 3D models or videos.</p></li></ul><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-AccessibilityFeatures">Accessibility Features</h3><ul><li><p>Individual Audio Adjustments</p></li><li><p>Voiceover</p></li><li><p>High-contrast and low contrast closed captions</p></li><li><p>Colour adjustment for characters</p></li></ul><p /><hr /><h2 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Gameplay"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-PrimaryObjective">Primary Objective</h3><p>The player&rsquo;s main objective is to complete the workday observing all of the employees and making adjustments and decisions along the way. These decisions will have a positive or negative impact on the production line.</p><p><span data-colorid="qwer8erxz2">Will we have a lose state?</span></p><p><span data-colorid="l0if6k5ii4">Advancements? We could gamify it more by adding a continuing saga that increases the challenge?</span></p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-SecondaryObjective">Secondary Objective</h3><ul><li><p>Learners familiarize themselves with the environment and the way employees move through it.</p></li><li><p>Learner improves their final score.</p></li><li><p>Learner writes their observations.</p></li></ul><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-GameplayProgression">Gameplay Progression</h3><p>The sim will have open-ended progression. It starts at 9AM and moves ahead until 5PM. Progression over the day will be static as the NPCs are meant to be performing the same actions over and over again. As the day continues, events will appear allowing the player to make decisions that impact the efficiency of the warehouse.</p><p><span data-colorid="vrnxma5mcm">Continued progression could be non-existent (ie. go back to square one no matter the outcome) or continue on with a second day. This could be a continuing storyline or something that increases in difficulty and ends when the player &ldquo;loses&rdquo;.</span></p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-PlayerMovement/Controller">Player Movement/Controller</h3><p>The player moves the camera rather than a physical character. They can click and drag to move around and zoom in and out with the mouse wheel.</p><p>Alternatively, we could also control it with WASD to move the camera in any direction and the arrow keys for added accessibility for different devices.</p><p>The player will have the ability to click on a specific area and see a close-up version of it. (For a first draft these can be pre-recorded videos.) Inside these &ldquo;bubbles&rdquo; the player&rsquo;s position will be fixed but they&rsquo;ll be able to move the camera around. They will also be able to go back at any given point. </p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-PlayerAbilities">Player Abilities</h3><p>The player will be able to make decisions that determine the outcome of the day. These events will happen at regular intervals but the event itself will be random picked from a collection of events.</p><ul><li><p>Manage breaks?</p></li><li><p>End shifts when ready?</p></li><li><p>Efficiency of Picker/Loader</p></li><li><p>Breaking up people talking during work.</p></li><li><p>Pause button that allows the learner to inspect details more closely.</p></li><li><p>Have characters interact with each other when they need help.</p></li><li><p>Tell characters to hurry up or slow down.</p></li><li><p>Tell characters to use specific equipment like a forklift.</p></li><li><p>Have manager inspect performance.</p></li><li><p>Purchase equipment such as barcode scanners.</p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="w9hecm31cc">Further details to be determined.</span></p></li></ul><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-ItemManagement">Item Management</h3><p>The player will be aware of the warehouse&rsquo;s inventory though they do not interact with it directly. It will be a piece of the UI with a number attached that represents the amount of inventory. The player will need to manage it so it&rsquo;s in a &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; where there&rsquo;s not too much inventory as that&rsquo;s wasted money but there&rsquo;s a healthy amount that people will continue to work.</p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Economy">Economy</h3><p>The two major economies will be time and inventory.</p><p>Time:</p><ul><li><p>Time will advance automatically (but will stop when an event appears)</p></li><li><p>Events will happen at regular intervals of time with slight variation.</p></li><li><p>Time will not be relative to real time (ie. each minute could be one second in real life).</p></li><li><p>Game ends automatically at a certain unspecified time.</p></li><li><p>Certain events will happen at designated times (like breaks)</p></li></ul><p>Inventory:</p><ul><li><p>Inventory will be a fluctuating number that the player will want to keep as low as possible. </p></li><li><p>If the inventory reaches 0 production stops but time continues on. <span data-colorid="jm07t31zc3">Need to ask CE the possibility of this or if it&rsquo;d be a positive or negative thing.</span></p></li><li><p>If inventory reaches a certain capacity it remains in trucks which causes wasted money.</p></li></ul><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Difficulty">Difficulty</h3><p>The game should be simple to understand but difficult to perfect. There will be many inefficiencies as a base statistic and increasing production efficiency will require a strong understanding of how to manage the the warehouse. This should come naturally as the student writes about what they see.</p><hr /><h2 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-GameWorld"><strong>Game World</strong></h2><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Scale">Scale</h3><p>The game will be played on a 3D plane from an isometric point of view. As such, the scale of everything will be skewed. However all items and major details will be correctly scaled in relativity to one another. Interactable things such as characters and unique items such as interactable boxes will be upscaled for better understanding.  </p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Details">Details</h3><ul><li><p>Boxes</p></li><li><p>Trucks</p></li><li><p>Forklifts</p></li><li><p>Chairs</p></li><li><p>Couches</p></li><li><p>Tables</p></li><li><p>Vending Machines</p></li><li><p>Palettes</p></li></ul><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-KeyLocations">Key Locations</h3><ul><li><p>Inbound</p></li><li><p>Outbound</p></li><li><p>Front Door</p></li><li><p>Offices</p></li><li><p>Storage</p></li><li><p>Order Picking</p></li><li><p>Lounge</p></li><li><p>Quality Assurance</p></li><li><p>Conveyer? (Might make things too efficient)</p></li></ul><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-PlayerCamera">Player Camera</h3><p>Top-down Isometric. The player will click and drag to move the camera and will be able to zoom in and out of the map.</p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Lighting">Lighting</h3><p>The scene will be lit in a realistic way to allow the student to feel like they&rsquo;re viewing a potentially real warehouse. We also don&rsquo;t want to highlight areas to give students a hint, they should be able to identify inefficiencies on their own merit.</p><p /><hr /><h2 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-StoryandNarrative"><strong>Story and Narrative</strong></h2><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-MainPlot">Main Plot</h3><p>You are an omnipotent viewer overseeing the production line of a small yet established warehouse. There have been some recent issues but on the whole the company has done well for itself. Your goal is to sit, watch and influence the employees in ways that highlight ways to make things more efficient.</p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-PlotProgression">Plot Progression</h3><p>Plot progression will be very light for this DLX. All of it will serve the gameplay for events or be backstory that is optional to read (aside from what&rsquo;s on Econestoga).</p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Storytelling">Storytelling</h3><p>Econestoga:</p><ul><li><p>Story details such as Warehouse information, supplier information, destinations etc. can be put into Econestoga as pages for the student to visit. This allows the instructor to know when a student has read the information. It also allows the instructor to change certain narrative details to fit the lesson plan.</p></li></ul><p>Character bios:</p><ul><li><p>Within the sim there will bios for each of the characters that highlight their personalities. In the end, these characteristics should influence the kinds of inefficiencies that appear. For example, one person might get distracted easily so they&rsquo;ll regularly be found goofing off more often than another character. Or for another character, it might be their first day on the job, so they don&rsquo;t know where all the equipment is as it&rsquo;s not properly laid out.</p></li></ul><p>Events:</p><ul><li><p>Random events will happen that can create a random unique story. For example, a shipment that was coming in today was in an accident. Half the inventory was lost and it will be delayed.</p></li></ul><p /><hr /><h2 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Characters"><strong>Characters</strong></h2><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-PlayerCharacter">Player Character</h3><p>The player takes on the role of a omnipotent manager overseeing the production pipeline of a warehouse. They view the world from a top-down perspective and have no physical presence in the game-world.</p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Non-PlayableCharacters(NPCs)">Non-Playable Characters (NPCs)</h3><p>The major NPCs within the sim will be the employees of the warehouse. The roles they will fulfill are as such:</p><ul><li><p>Material Handler (multiple)</p></li><li><p>Cycle Counter</p></li><li><p>Picker </p></li><li><p>Packer</p></li><li><p>Shipper</p></li><li><p>Manager</p></li><li><p>WMS (Warehouse management system, a sentient AI like Glados)</p></li></ul><p>To start with, the sim will focus development on the Material Handler working on inbound inventory and the picker. </p><p>Each NPC will have their own personality and biography detailing as such on the DLX. These biographies will likely be flavour text however they could influence their attitudes during work. </p><p><span data-colorid="slifqhg9tm">An idea for WMS, it could be the narrator guiding you through the sim. It can give you the basic insight at the start and read out the events. It can also make small comments throughout the sim to give it some life.</span></p><p /><hr /><h2 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-SoundDesign"><strong>Sound Design</strong></h2><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Overview">Overview</h3><p>This DLX will lean slightly towards the silly side so it should have some reserved yet fun music playing throughout. It will also include a variety of sound effects both diegetic and non-diegetic.</p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-MusicandSFX">Music and SFX</h3><p>There will be two songs, one for the main menu and then another while the game is actually being played. SFX will include diegetic sounds like forklifts, beeps of a barcode scanner a truck unloading it&rsquo;s cargo etc. It will also include non-diegetic sounds such as UI sounds, sounds to indicate certain actions by NPCs, like a jingle or a depressing horn. There should also be an applause sound effect when the day is complete.</p><h4 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Sources">Sources</h4><p><span data-colorid="lf3ttj8olf">List the sources for the music and sound effect so they can be properly credited.</span></p><h4 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Music">Music</h4><p><span data-colorid="pbss8y4kzg">List the music used and where.</span></p><h4 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-SoundEffects">Sound Effects</h4><p><span data-colorid="phbcnpthz4">List the sound effects used and where.</span></p><h4 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-BackgroundAudio">Background Audio</h4><p><span data-colorid="d8p4gw6aw2">List the background audio used and where.</span></p><h4 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Voiceover">Voiceover</h4><p>Voiceover will play clearly for the WMS companion. The employees should make mumbling noises.</p><p /><hr /><h2 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Tools"><strong>Tools</strong></h2><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Unity">Unity</h3><p>Unity will be the game engine the DLX is developed in.</p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Econestoga">Econestoga</h3><p>The integration of the DLX with Econestoga includes both the Sim itself as well as supplemental material. This material could include narrative details that the instructor could change themselves. This could also supplement narrative elements within the DLX to start. Giving more time for development of the mechanics while adding narrative back in at a later date.</p><p /><hr /><h2 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-OtherInfo"><strong>Other Info</strong></h2><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Playtime">Playtime</h3><p>The average playtime should be estimated to be within 15-25 minutes, depending on how much time it takes the learner to choose options and pause the DLX.</p><h3 id="SupplyChainGameDesignDocument-Risks">Risks</h3><p>This sim is very much outside the wheelhouse of what the VARLab has done in the past. It needs to be properly scaffolded to release a build in the given timeframe and then subsequent consistent updates. </p>
