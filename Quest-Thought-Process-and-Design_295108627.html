                    <h3 id="QuestThoughtProcessandDesign-WayfindingQuest">Wayfinding Quest</h3><p><strong>Introduction Apartment (Stretch Goal)</strong></p><p>The game begins in Cliff’s(The condor) residence. The player will need to walk around the apartment picking up objects left around that they’ll need for school.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">This is to act as a short tutorial to give the players a chance to familiarize themselves with the game while getting a checklist of generic objects they’ll need for school.</p><p /><p><strong>Introduction Bus (Stretch Goal)</strong></p><p>As the player exits the apartment, they’re transported onto a bus on their way to campus. They’re sitting in the front of the bus when it stops, lowers the lift and a person in a wheelchair arrives onto the bus. They ask Cliff for the spot they’re sitting in. </p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">The player will have the option to either get up on their own or refuse to which the bus driver tells them that the spots are reserved. The player is given the choice here to introduce that slight bit of interaction that offers some fun agency. Of course, since this is a learning tool, Cliff will move out of the seat no matter what.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">This is meant to be a slice of the detail that the lore quest offers.</p><p /><p><strong>Door 3</strong></p><p>Leaving the bus, Cliff arrives at door 3 where they meet Ezra, a nervous person who is arriving at the college for the first time. Once interacted with, Ezra will ask Cliff to accompany him to the library and joins the party. They enter through Door 3.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">The player will have a small amount of freedom in the area outside of door 3, however they won’t be able to enter the school through any other door and they need Ezra with them. This section is mandatory to bring the player straight into the narrative of the game and so they don’t get lost immediately in the school.</p><p /><p><strong>A Wing and B Wing</strong></p><p>Entering the school, the player must make their through A wing into B wing to reach the library. </p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">The entire area is open to the player, they will be heavily directed towards the information desk where they can get an idea as to where they need to go, though NPCs will also help point them in the right direction.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">The player can begin the second main quest here by speaking to President Tibbits.</p><p /><p><strong>The Library</strong></p><p>The library is fully explorable, but the player needs to interact with an empty computer to advance. Ezra prints off a form and signs it. The two decide that they’re hungry and head off towards the Cafeteria.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">The reasoning for Ezra and Cliff to go to the library doesn’t entirely matter; there are many reasons to go to the library that we can choose. At the end of the day, it’s most important that the player knows exactly where the library is. </p><p /><p><strong>Cafeteria</strong></p><p>Cliff and Ezra find the cafeteria and order from any of the establishments. Once they do, they find a seat and talk to each other while they eat.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">The reasoning behind this one is simply that students want to know where they can relax and eat/purchase food. The conversation afterwards is to promote interactivity with other students during lunch.</p><p /><p><strong>The Venue</strong></p><p>After they eat, Ezra mentions that he heard the venue was holding a guest speaker and decides to go check it out. After arriving at the venue, the player seats themselves beside Asmee, an international student from India. Cliff and Ezra catch the tail-end of the speaker. Asmee introduces herself and joins the party. She mentions that she forgot to purchase supplies online before school started. They head towards the book store.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">The venue is a spot that many students don’t seem to know about, so we believe it beneficial to show students where and how to reach it. They must talk with NPCs to be given directions to the venue.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">The venue is a popular spot for events and we believe a guest speaker to be the best choice as people can just walk in during one, we only need to worry about writing the end and it can just be one character made within RPG Maker rather than a unique sprite.</p><p /><p><strong>Book Store</strong></p><p>Once the player reaches the book store, they can interact with the clerk to purchase items for themselves, textbooks for themselves or choose to purchase Asmee’s books (Note, Cliff does not purchase them, rather the player initiates it.) </p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">The book store is an important place to visit for new students. While they can purchase books and items online and have it delivered, not every student will know to do that. So, if they’re already at Conestoga it’s best if they can just purchase and pick up their items there.</p><p /><p /><p />
