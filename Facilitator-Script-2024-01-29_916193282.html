VARLab stads for Virtual and Augmented Reality Lab, we are part of Conestoga College and are currently located at the Waterloo campus. The VARLab’s main purpose is developing these simulations for various programs in the College. These are meant to recreate situations that would be too dangerous, too expensive or counterproductive to set up in real life. </p><p>For example today we will be looking at a car crash scene and you will have to investigate the crash. Setting this up in real life where each one of you gets a different car crash would mean crashing about eighty cars against each other in a way that is realistic enough for you. I’m sure you can already figure out how this would be extremely dangerous and not very cost effective. </p><p>The other big point for these experiences is that each student gets a front row seat. You won’t have to worry about someone blocking your view if you are at the back of the class, or someone else tampering with your work. You get this experience just for you without anyone else getting in the way.</p><p>Moving on to what we will be doing today. <em><strong>If you haven’t done this already, I would ask you to go now to the material on your course and get it to start loading since it can take quite a while to do so. </strong></em></p><p>A very important thing that we need you to have in mind through this whole exercise, is that you are not the ones being evaluated today. We are here to test this particular simulation with our intended audience, who are students like you. The one being evaluated is the simulation, to see if it provides enough information for you to be successful and find where the gaps are so we can fix them as best as we can. </p><p>For this we will need your help, if at any moment you get stuck, please raise your hand and one of us will come to you. We won’t be able to tell you exactly what you need to do to move forward, but we want to hear why you got stuck. If there was something you expected to happen but it didn’t, if something didn’t react you would expect it to in real life, if you feel like something is missing for you to be able to move forward, and so on. Like I mentioned at the start, we are part of the User Research team, which means we are not part of the team who designed or developed this simulation, <em><strong>[big smile]</strong></em> so don’t feel bad about bringing up things that don’t work, you won’t be hurting our feelings. This also means we aren’t experts on the specifics of how the software works, so we might not have the answers on how to move forward. But like we mentioned before, our work here is to look precisely at those issues and document them, so please let us know when you encounter them and we’ll come around. </p><p>We will be putting on the whiteboard the time at which we will be starting the testing as well as when it’s going to end. On the post-it notes next to you, you will find that there’s a number and some extra space underneath. The number is for us to be able to keep track of questions or comments you share with us while using the simulation in our notes. Anything you tell us will be recorded anonymously, but since you might speak with more than one of us today, we want to make sure we can cross-reference our notes later. In the extra space we would like you to record the time at which you started and ended each scenario you go through. This is just for us to get a rough average of how long it takes to complete them. Once the time for going through the scenarios is done, we want you to take some time to fill in a form with questions regarding your experience today, and that would be the last thing for today. </p><p>We will now play a video that will cover what we expect you to do with the simulation and after that we should be good to start. Thanks everyone for your time and please if you have any questions or need help at any point, raise your hand and we will come help you.</p><p>[Play video]</p><p>Alright everyone, it’s (current time), we have until (ending time) to go through the scenarios. We will let you know when there are 15 and 5 minutes left. You don’t need to finish all of the scenarios, do them at your own pace and don’t feel like you’re being rushed to finish when we give you the time warning!</p><p />
