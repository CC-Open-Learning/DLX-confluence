This is from the student's point of view, at approx eye level, lasting no more than a few seconds to help orient the learner to the simulation environment. </p><p>The voiceover will welcome the student and advise them to follow the prompts to practice a walk-around inspection of the truck and trailer exterior.  Students will be prompted to observe each inspectable item in order. </p><h2 id="ReleaseI-GuidedModeUserExperience-CameraBehaviour"><span data-colorid="u7wath97ix">Camera Behaviour</span> </h2><p>In Guided Mode, the camera will move automatically for each inspection, there will be no need for the learner to navigate manually using either keyboard or mouse.  The Guided Mode inspection walks the student through the inspection process so that the student does not decide what to inspect or in what order.  It is important to note that the student will have no control over the order of the inspection steps - they will be required to go through the inspection in a set order, with no opportunity to skip ahead or return to a previous step.  </p><h2 id="ReleaseI-GuidedModeUserExperience-InteractionModel"><span data-colorid="wtv0ootypq">Interaction Model</span></h2><p>There are two types of inspections in this simulation: Visual and Physical.  </p><p><strong>Visual inspections</strong> are passive - they require no extra action to identify the condition of the component being inspected - the student will simply observe the model and decide whether or not to report damage for the component that is shown.  Examples of visual inspections would include Windows, Mirrors, and Exterior Condition.</p><p><strong>Physical inspections</strong> are active - these inspections require a simulated action beyond just looking.  Examples of physical inspections would include Tire Pressure, where the student needs to thump the tire with a mallet to evaluate the air pressure, or Van Doors, where the student needs to unlatch and open the doors. To trigger a physical inspection, the learner will be prompted to click on an icon in the Physical Inspection tray.  </p><p>Note: At each position of the inspection process, only the applicable icons will be available in the physical inspection tray.  These icons will change as the learner progresses to each stage of the inspection, so that the icon tray doesn&rsquo;t get too crowded or overwhelming.  Each icon will be enabled when the student is prompted to trigger that inspection.</p><p>For all inspection interactions, the learner will observe the virtual truck model to evaluate the condition of the component, and will have two options for how to respond:  Report Damage or .</p><p><strong>Report Damage:</strong> If the learner sees something wrong (or questionable), they will click on the item.  Clicking on the model will trigger the Inspection UI dialogue box, which will provide selectable options for what types of damage/wear could occur for this component.  These options are customized for each component, so that only applicable options are displayed for the specific component (ie. tires will offer options such as excessive tread wear or embedded object, while lights will offer options such as cracked or burnt out).  In Guided Mode, the learner will have immediate feedback when they select an option from the Inspection UI - the background colour of the option they select will change to green (if they have correctly identified the state of the component) or it will change to red (if they have incorrectly identified the state of the component).  The learner will have the opportunity to change their answer as many times as they need to, until they get the &ldquo;green&rdquo; result.  Note that the Inspection UI is ONLY used for reporting damage/wear.  There is no option in the dialog to report that a component is in good condition.</p><p><strong>Next Inspection (Nothing to Report):</strong> If the learner does not see anything wrong with the component under inspection, they will click the &ldquo;Next Inspection&rdquo; button in the toolbar to move on to the next component. This will prevent the learner from having to report components that are in good condition, which will make the inspection process true to real-life practice where only damage/wear is reported. In Guided Mode, the student will not be allowed to move on while there is unreported damage/wear.  If they fail to report damage that is present, the voiceover will prompt them to take a closer look, and will remind them about what to look for.  If the learner has successfully identified all damage/wear for a particular inspectable component, the Next Inspection button will move them to the next inspectable component at this position.  When all components at a particular position have been inspected successfully, the Next Inspection button will move the learner to the next position.</p><h2 id="ReleaseI-GuidedModeUserExperience-Position#1-DriversSideFront(DSF)">Position #1 - Drivers Side Front (DSF)</h2><p>The camera will stop at the front driver's side corner of the vehicle, angled so that the camera is looking at most of the front and driver's side of the truck.&nbsp; This will be called Position DSF.
