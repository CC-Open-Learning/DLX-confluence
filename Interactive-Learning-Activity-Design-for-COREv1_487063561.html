Specifically, we are looking to eliminate our dependency on &ldquo;rapid development&rdquo; platforms such as VTS Editor and H5P, when we believe that we can provide substantially better user experiences without the high cost and overhead of using external dev platforms. As such, these interactions will all be designed with minimal to no 3D models involved.  It&rsquo;s not so much that 3D modelling is not allowed, it&rsquo;s more that we are encouraging the use of photo/video assets as a way to demonstrate that rapid simulation development is possible using only developers (no 3D artists). VARLab has much better access to development resources than art resources, and we want to play to our strengths.</p><h3 id="InteractiveLearningActivityDesignforCOREv1-EngagingandInteractive">Engaging and Interactive </h3><p>On this page, we will focus on designing user interactions that can be leveraged to deliver DLS user experiences that are HIGH ENGAGING, INTERACTIVE and GAMIFIED.  Many of our recent CORE sims have been focused on inspections, so we want to shake off that task-driven, checklist-style experience and really explore opportunities to get the learner engaged with the content.</p><p>Our model for these learning experiences will always follow our EXPLAIN - SHOW - DO learning model, where we make sure that every learning objective supported with the following elements:</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="glus4yukxz">EXPLAIN </span></strong>- Clear, concise explanation of the content. Exactly WHAT does the learner need to know and WHY.</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="jvtm4acyar">SHOW</span></strong> - Demonstrate, using photo or video, exactly HOW the learner should perform the required action(s).</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="ic3xqaobrl">DO</span></strong> - Provide an engaging activity for the learner to participate in to PRACTICE the required action(s) and consolidate their knowledge.</p><h3 id="InteractiveLearningActivityDesignforCOREv1-SupportDiverseLearningStyles">Support Diverse Learning Styles</h3><p>It is essential that we reduce our dependence on reading and listening as our primary methods of delivering learning content.  Expanding our use of meaningful interactive learning will help us to reach and promote success of learners whose English language skills are still developing, or whose literacy is not strong.  Many of our programs are focused on hands-on learning rather than traditional book study, and we want to make sure that our DLS simulations are designed with hands-on learning at the forefront.</p><h2 id="InteractiveLearningActivityDesignforCOREv1-DesignIdeas">Design Ideas</h2><p>In no particular order, we will create one page for each design idea, where we will explore use cases and implementation strategies for each one.</p><ol><li><p><a href="487358491.html" data-linked-resource-id="487358491" data-linked-resource-version="2" data-linked-resource-type="page">Drag &amp; Drop - Sort and Match</a></p></li><li><p><a href="Dynamic-Photo-Transformation-with-Mouse-Cursor_487456769.html" data-linked-resource-id="487456769" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">Dynamic Photo Transformations with Mouse Cursor</a></p></li><li><p><a class="external-link" href="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/l/c/ewouky7w" rel="nofollow">Jigsaw Puzzle Assemble and Disassemble</a></p></li></ol>
