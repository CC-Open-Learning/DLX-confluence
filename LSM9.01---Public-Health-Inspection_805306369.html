Biggest problem was load time, which exceeded 10 minutes at its worst.  Keep in mind that students will not typically be loading the DLX all at once, on campus wifi, when they using this DLX as part of their course.  They will frequently be working at home or during non-peak hours, which will improve load times considerably.  We will watch and monitor to see if this is a serious concern, but Ken was not worried.</p></li><li><p>The prototype of downloadable results is a success, has been tested successfully during cross-team testing.  What remains is to develop this feature with the content that we need (currently only the Activity Log is downloaded). Meeting with Ken on Oct 1 for input - we will add a short “executive summary” at the top of the downloaded PDF with some quick references, student name, full date/timestamp, scenario #, and elapsed time.  Ken will test the downloaded images in the 26SEP2024 demo build including adding them to a Hedgehog report to make sure that the size and resolution is suitable.</p></li><li><p>All team members agree that we should be feature complete at the end of this sprint, with no charter requirements remaining.  The next 2-3 sprints will be focused on final testing, polishing, performance optimizations, GR requirements (internal VARLab requirements such as Analytics, promo video, etc), and documentation.  Target GR is set for Nov 8-15 (approx Fall 24 - Sprint 6), pending success of remaining objectives.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><time datetime="2024-09-23" class="date-past">23 Sep 2024</time> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>Following successful milestone release, and while we are waiting for student feedback, the team is working on tackling our remaining scope for GR:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Export DLX Results as PDF</strong> - The goal is to have a working prototype that will leverage existing Print feature.  We will generate a PDF (not much content for now, just proof of concept at this point) from inside the DLX, and allow the user to download it using the Save as PDF option in Print.</p></li><li><p><strong>Export Gallery Images as JPG </strong>- We don’t want to embed images from inspections in the Results PDF, because students will need to use them as individual image files for upload to Hedgehog.  For this reason, we will work on a functional prototype to export photos from inside the DLX to a standard file size, display size, and resolution that is adequate for the purpose of being used in Hedgehog, but not so large that it will make the download risky.  We need to name the image files the same way the images are identified in the DLX, so that they can be easily related to the exported PDF Inspection Log or Activity Log.</p></li><li><p><strong>Analytics</strong> - We have an older analytics package in PHI, so we need to upgrade to the latest version and implement the trigger points for Start/Restart and Complete DLX, using the elapsed time feature in the game to increment the total minutes played metric.</p></li></ul></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><time datetime="2024-09-13" class="date-past">13 Sep 2024</time> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>Successful milestone release of <a class="external-link" href="https://stuconestogacon.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/VARLab/EYeab2cY5K9LlHhn4PPpxPUBYnPPPKuEZooRwCd4chTjJA?e=wHwBm9" rel="nofollow">PHI-24F1.6 - 12SEP2024.zip</a> was approved by VLT and delivered to the CE on Friday, Sep 13, 2024.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><time datetime="2024-08-26" class="date-past">26 Aug 2024</time> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>After a review of the remaining backlog, this project continues to be ahead of schedule.

We have never implemented this type of functionality before in eConestoga, although we have some externally developed DLX products that have done this.  Because it is our first time, we should expect to encounter elevated risks and unforeseen obstacles that need to be overcome.</p></li><li><p>Tutorial - Some of our DLX require a tutorial that helps students understand how to play, or helps them to succeed in the tasks they need to perform (what to look for, how to choose, etc).  The requirements for PHI are not well defined at this time, but the UI design for the PHI welcome screen implies that a tutorial “How to Play” will be included in the GR.  We need to figure out (through observation and surveys of the students participating in the milestone release) what the requirements are so that we can make sure student needs are met.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Considering that these two features are the only remaining scope for this project, we can move our GR target into the F24 term with medium-high confidence at this time.  We no longer anticipate that PHI will continue into the W25 term, but of course we are prepared to extend Phase 3 dev if unplanned work is discovered that is critical to student success.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><time datetime="2024-07-18" class="date-past">18 Jul 2024</time> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>At today’s Playable Demo meeting, our CE Ken Diplock requested to be able to use the DLX in his course for the Fall 2024 term.

Originally, we intended to provide evaluative feedback about the correct/incorrect/validity of the Inspection Log items.  For example, if the student reported an inspectable as Compliant but it was Non-Compliant, we would provide feedback to the student to let them know that their judgement of that inspectable was incorrect.  HOWEVER, we have learned now that this type of judgement is actually highly contextual and depends on many factors that are not possible to assess in our DLX inspection.   For example, a rice bucket stored directly on the floor in the pantry would be non-compliant if that is the permanent storage spot for that item. However, just seeing the rice bucket on the floor does not tell the student inspector how long it has been there, or if it is currently in use (being refilled, being used in a food prep workflow). This is just one of many examples, where the student would need to consider other factors to determine if something they see in the DLX is compliant or non-compliant.  <strong>For this reason, we WILL NOT EVALUATE the inspection results at the end of the playthrough</strong>. We will provide the Inspection Log and Gallery of photos, but we will not try to provide feedback about the correctness/incorrectness of any inspection results.</p></li><li><p>Other focus group feedback was at the small-refinement level, to improve the usability and flow.

The inspection workflow will be just like all other inspections, where the student will click on the handwashing station to see a close-up view and will be able to take photos or temperature readings, as well as mark the handwashing station as Compliant or Non-Compliant.  Note that there are no planned non-compliances for handwashing stations, so they will all be compliant.

That discussion is still ongoing, with a hope that we can get by with a bare minimum of user guidance (CE requested no user prompts, no reminders, students must have the opportunity to forget important steps of the inspection process) and minimal feedback.  For example, instead of giving step by step prompts and immediate feedback, we could consider a “Summary” type of feedback, either periodically or at the end of the inspection (on demand?) Not sure what this would look like yet.  We may wish to consider a scorecard type of feedback to let the inspector know # of POI’s out of total # were inspected (did the user visit that POI) and # of non-compliances out of total # that were identified (not sure how they identify the non-compliances, we can work on that).</p></li><li><p>During this meeting, Russ identified that we need to leverage the recent research about <strong>Brightspace LTI integration</strong> for this project, so that we can <strong>export “results” (photos and measurements taken in the DLX, for example) directly into eConestoga</strong> (NOT emailed or downloaded to the student).  We also need to track things like <strong># of times this user has played</strong>, and which scenarios (bad state sets) they have played. None of this is possible using SCORM integration, so these are bold new requirements.  I communicated to the team via chat immediately following the meeting with Russ, Ujjwal and Josh are following up to investigate what is possible with LTI.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><time datetime="2023-09-18" class="date-past">18 Sep 2023</time> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>Design kickoff</p></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="LSM9.01-PublicHealthInspection-TypeofSolution">Type of Solution</h2><p>Procedural - Flatscreen</p><p>(PoV) (3D Models &amp; Assets) </p><p>This project will be a virtual public health inspection of a restaurant, with the learner acting in the role of public health inspector.</p><ol start="1"><li><p><strong>Flat screen DLX</strong> - will be used online and must be accessible outside of class hours, therefore flatscreen web deployment is required.</p></li><li><p>DLX must have <strong>Save &amp; Load</strong> feature, so that the student’s progress is automatically saved as they play the simulation. If the student exits before completing the scenario, they are offered the option to Continue from where they left off or Start from beginning the next time they log in. If a student has never played before, or if they completed their scenario on their previous session, they will not need to make a choice - the scenario will load from the beginning.</p></li><li><p>The inspection procedure is more of a checklist than a sequence, in that there is <strong>no specific order or priority for tasks</strong> to be done. The student can navigate freely to any area of the facility, in any order, and complete any number of tasks in each area, in any order. There are <strong>two mandatory tasks</strong> that the player must complete before they can begin the inspection. If the user does not perform both of these tasks (without being prompted) before they begin the inspection, the game will end and they will need to start over from the beginning:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Identify themselves as a public health inspector, to establish that they have authority to enter</p></li><li><p>Wash their hands</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>No task prompts</strong>. It is up to the student to perform the inspection as they see fit, just like in real life.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tools available at all times</strong>: The student will be provided with the following tools in the DLX, and can decide to use them at any time, for any purpose, according to the following functionality:</p><ol start="1"><li><p><strong>Flashlight </strong>- to illuminate dark areas such as behind appliances or under tables.</p></li><li><p><strong>Camera </strong>- to capture photos in game. All photos can be reviewed in game so that the student can determine if the photo is appropriate. Camera tool must be able to zoom and pan. <strong>Images captured in the game must be available to the student (e.g. sent by email, downloadable to local drive or Dropbox, etc.) at the conclusion of the user session</strong>. All captured photos must be retained as part of Save &amp; Load. After completing the scenario, the photos are no longer retained in the game and the student cannot download/export them again.</p></li><li><p><strong>Probe Thermometer</strong> - to take a temperature reading. The student does not have to operate the thermometer, they just select the probe thermometer and click on the item that they want to assess. A temperature reading will be shown in the format of XXX.X (up to 3 whole numbers followed by one decimal place) in degrees Celcius.</p></li><li><p><strong>Infrared (IR) Thermometer</strong> - to take a temperature reading. The student does not have to operate the thermometer, they just select IR thermometer and click on the item they wish to assess. The temperature reading will be shown in the format of XXX.X (up to 3 whole numbers followed by one decimal place) in degrees Celcius.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>This DLX will focus on <strong>decision-based procedural learning</strong> (e.g. choose WHAT to do, such as take a temperature reading or a photo) as opposed to more tactical learning (e.g. HOW to properly wash your hands or take a temperature). The student will decide all of the following:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Where to start the inspection and how to proceed (there is no prescribed order for tasks, other than the 2 mandatory starting tasks identified above)</p></li><li><p>Which tools to use (camera, probe thermometer, IR thermometer) for which tasks - all tools are available all the time</p></li><li><p>How to record the results of the inspection - the student may choose to open a different application (e.g. Hedgehog, Notepad) in another tab or window, or physically write down their findings in a paper notebook, or any method that suits them. The DLX does not provide any way to record inspection findings, this is entirely up to the student.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Scorecard-style feedback</strong> at the end of the inspection. The student will decide when the inspection is completed, they will need to click to end the inspection. When they end the inspection (confirm that action) we can show a scorecard of their inspection results. We need to work out exactly how much feedback is appropriate, since the user is generally recording their findings outside of the game and we can’t evaluate if they are correct or incorrect. At the very least, we can know what you clicked (every location you navigated to, every photo, every temperature) but we won’t be able to tell what you noticed or didn’t notice, or if your findings were correct.</p></li></ol><p /><h2 id="LSM9.01-PublicHealthInspection-ObjectivesforPublicHealthInspection">Objectives for Public Health Inspection</h2><p>The objectives for this DLX are to provide opportunities for the student to practice their skills in an engaging and pragmatic environment.  Students will be fully trained in how to conduct each step of the inspection, as well as studying conditional steps and when to perform them, before they ever play the DLX for the first time.  As such, the goal of this DLX is not to introduce any concept or skill, but to provide a practice space where students can apply what they have learned in class.</p><h2 id="LSM9.01-PublicHealthInspection-SummaryofInspectableObjects">Summary of Inspectable Objects</h2><p>This table will serve as a summary of all inspectables in the virtual restaurant.
