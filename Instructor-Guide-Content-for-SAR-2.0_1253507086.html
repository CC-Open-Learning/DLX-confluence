Until VR training became available, students had to make a very big leap from the classroom to live fire, and not all of them were ready.  VR training acts like a stepping stone between classroom learning and early practice, by providing a safe, environmentally friendly, but immersive and experience-based learning environment.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-left-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-left" alt="image-20240801-005950.png" width="400" loading="lazy" src="attachments/1253507086/1253376037.png?width=400" data-image-src="attachments/1253507086/1253376037.png" data-height="434" data-width="602" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="1253376037" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20240801-005950.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="1253507086" data-linked-resource-container-version="8" data-media-id="8e556148-c45b-4bf1-8c97-0cebee83b7ea" data-media-type="file" /></span><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>PLEASE NOTE:  VR enhances and augments classroom learning, it is <strong>never intended to reduce or replace in-person fire ground or physical training </strong>for student firefighters.

Every VR workstation has a display monitor that will show you where that student is located and what they are currently seeing in their headset. You can also do a quick overview anytime from the Command station by clicking on the tabs at the top of the screen. The most popular view options are detailed below: </p><p><strong>4 SCREEN</strong> - This shows you what each of the 4 students can see in their headset, all at the same time. This updates in real time so that you can keep track of what each student is doing and see what they see.</p><p><strong>MINIMAP</strong> - You can monitor student position in the virtual scene using the MINIMAP tab, which shows the layout diagram of the house along with small colour-coded icons to represent each student.  The icons will move when then students move. You can observe each floor of the house, as well as the exterior.</p><h2 id="InstructorGuideContentforSAR2.0-HowDoesRole-PlayingHelpinLearning?"><span data-colorid="q5syvo12kw">How Does Role-Playing Help in Learning?</span></h2><p>Role-playing is a really important part of making these scenarios feel more realistic.  Preparing students for live-fire training includes helping them practice lots of skills at once, under some pressure, so that they can build their confidence.  The VR simulation only has 4 players and a place to work, so the rest of the narrative is up to the instructor to supply. So how do we do that? </p><p><strong>Unit assignments </strong>- Each participant in the simulation can represent a separate unit (Pump 1, Pump 2, Tank 3, Ladder 4, Car 23) so that they can be dispatched and assigned to different roles when they &ldquo;arrive on scene&rdquo;.  In some scenarios, the instructor might choose to have all 4 students play together as a group, and that works too.  It is important to recognize that there are very few truly collaborative tasks in the simulation (really, just the alpha door forcible entry task).  For this reason, many instructors will choose to split students up as if each student was acting captain for an imaginary crew.  Because there is no hose to bump, no nozzle, there isn&rsquo;t a lot for additional crew members to do after making entry to the house.</p><p><strong>Dispatch </strong>- Someone in the room (often the VR Facilitator or one of the students) acts as the dispatcher to kick off the scene.  Students learn to listen to the dispatch call and respond appropriately through this role play activity.  </p><p><strong>Incident Command</strong> - The instructor in the room usually acts in the role of Incident Command, and communicates with Fire Dispatch and with each &ldquo;unit&rdquo; while they are in the simulation, providing a great opportunity to build communication skills, practice 360 size-ups, CAN reports, and PARs. The instructor can evolve the scene by calling an evacuation order, or communicating new information such as a family member who reports their teenage son is in the basement playing video games.  Instructors might choose to have a student play the role of I.C., which can actually help students appreciate the role.</p><p><strong>RIT </strong>- Sometimes, instructors will secretly communicate to one of the students that they should &ldquo;go dark&rdquo; in the middle of an evolution.  This usually means that the student will sit or lie down on the mat and stop responding to comms.  The player is still visible in the game, so this can be used as a custom Mayday scenario, where students practice situational awareness (Wasn&rsquo;t Pump 3 supposed to be searching the 2nd floor? Why haven&rsquo;t we seen them?) and calling a Mayday when encountering an unresponsive firefighter in the scene.</p><p><strong>Accountability</strong> - In groups where there are more than 8 students, extra students off headset can be assigned to practice keeping an accountability board on the whiteboard at the front of the classroom.  This is a really engaging activity that helps students learn to listen to radio chatter to keep up with every unit, their position, assignment, fire conditions, time on air, etc.  The student(s) practicing accountability can call a PAR and each unit can practice responding to that call.</p><p><strong>Imaginary Tasks</strong> - SAR 2.0 is all about search and rescue - it does not yet support other roles/tasks that are essential at a live fire.  Some instructors will assign imaginary tasks that a player can&rsquo;t actually DO in the game, but it still gets students thinking about those tasks and where/how they would tackle those assignments in the scene.  Examples of imaginary tasks might include establishing water supply, stretching a hose line, shutting off power at the electrical panel, laddering a window, venting a roof, etc etc.  Just imagining these tasks, and communicating appropriately about them with I.C. can be valuable from a learning perspective.</p><p /><h2 id="InstructorGuideContentforSAR2.0-WhatCanStudentsDointheVRSimulation?"><span data-colorid="m6g657nsac">What Can Students Do in the VR Simulation?</span></h2><p>The simulation starts with students already fully kitted out in bunker gear and SCBA, and equipped with tools (flashlight, halligan bar, etc.). Students can practice various skills and routines, including but not limited to:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Up to 4 students can participate in the same scenario at once</strong>.  These students can see each other and interact in the scene.  Most activities in the VR simulation are for a single player to do the action and other players can observe or handle communications, with the exception of the forcible entry on the alpha door.  That is a truly collaborative task for 2 players.  The instructor can choose to assign students to different tasks, or keep them together as a team.</p></li><li><p>Radio <strong>communications</strong>, including dispatch and response, <strong>CAN reports</strong>, calling and responding to a <strong>PAR</strong>, and other situation-based communications such as finding a victim, calling a <strong>mayday</strong>, or responding to an <strong>evacuation</strong> order.  These skills can be practiced in any classroom, but the scenario-based context of practicing these skills in VR can only be compared with practice on the fire ground.</p></li><li><p><strong>SCBA </strong>- Students do not don or doff PPE or SCBA in this simulation, but they do operate their SCBA almost as they usually would.  Students must <strong>turn their air on and off </strong>when appropriate, and they can check their air (in PSI) whenever they want.  Their HUD lights are visible as they play, and they will update accordingly as their air is consumed. There is no motion sensor in the VR simulation, so the PASS will only alarm if the student lets their air get really low.  Air is consumed at a steady rate, and cylinders can be replaced by visiting the Conestoga Fire truck &ldquo;rehab&rdquo; station at the end of the driveway. </p></li></ul><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-warning confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>NOTE: Students that run out of air (or fail to turn it on) will be <strong>blacked out</strong> and exited from the scenario. This does not cause any physical harm to students, but it can induce feelings of panic and stress responses in students, because it can feel very real for them. Students might need support and de-briefing following this type of experience. </p></div></div><ul><li><p><strong>360 size-ups </strong>are great in the simulation. The houses themselves do not change, but the fire and smoke conditions vary with the selected scenario, and students can practice identifying alternate egress, exposures, utilities, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Forcible entry </strong>on the alpha door is a 2-person activity that requires collaboration and communication between students.</p></li><li><p><strong>Body position (standing vs crawling)</strong> Students have to physically get down on the floor and make crawling motions when they are in a hot smoky environment.  Standing up, they can&rsquo;t see very well, so they learn to get low.</p></li><li><p>Obviously, <strong>search and rescue protocols</strong> are the primary activity in every scenario.  As students practice their primary and secondary search protocols, they are also practicing <strong>personal orientation</strong> in the structure (Where are you right now? Where is the closest egress?) and <strong>situational awareness</strong> (Have you located the seat of the fire? Have you finished searching the kitchen?)</p></li></ul><h2 id="InstructorGuideContentforSAR2.0-WhatCAN’TStudentsDointheVRSimulation?"><span data-colorid="f8mjpjv226">What CAN&rsquo;T Students Do in the VR Simulation?</span></h2><p>This VR experience is pretty new, and there are still a LOT of things you can&rsquo;t do.  Here are a few of the most asked-about skills or features that do not yet exist in the VR simulation:</p><ul><li><p><strong>No fire attack </strong>activities are included in the experience at all.  There are no hydrants, hoses, nozzles or extinguishers. You just have to imagine that part.</p></li><li><p><strong>No evolution of fire conditions</strong> during the scenario.  However the fire and smoke look at the beginning of the scenario, that&rsquo;s how they will look the whole time.  Nothing makes the fire or the smoke any better or any worse.</p></li><li><p><strong>No ventilation or VEIS</strong>  Windows in this simulation do not open and cannot be broken.  There are no high pressure ventilation units, and leaving doors open or closed does not affect the smoke or fire.</p></li><li><p><strong>No ladders </strong>or aerials. <strong>No roof access</strong>.  <strong>No access to the garage from outside</strong> (only through interior door). The only way to get into or out of the virtual houses is to use the doors provided.</p></li><li><p><strong>No carry options for extricating patients</strong>.  Students can only grab and drag victims that they find inside the structure, and they can only drag victims while they are crawling.   In real life, students will need to use critical thinking and situational awareness to figure out the best way to get patients out of a dangerous situation, including 2-person carry options, but in this simulation they don&rsquo;t have any options.  This is a good discussion to have in class.</p></li><li><p><strong>No other types of structures.</strong>  We are aware that it would be very useful to have different types of settings for practicing Search and Rescue, but so far we just have these two houses.  We are dedicated to the continued growth of this VR learning experience, and hope to offer a wider variety of structures in the future, such as highrise apartments, rowhouse/townhouses, schools or retirement/nursing homes, commercial/retail structures, etc.</p></li></ul><h1 id="InstructorGuideContentforSAR2.0-I’mIn!HowDoesThisWork?">I&rsquo;m In!

You might be wondering why VR training doesn&rsquo;t work like that?  Here are some reasons:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Why Not Bigger Groups? </strong>VR training requires a very specialized space, with expensive equipment, network capabilities, and IT support.  We&rsquo;re working with the resources we&rsquo;ve got, but this could change in the future.</p></li><li><p><strong>What If We Had More Space?</strong> Remember that the simulation does not provide any guidance or any feedback to students.  The only way they can learn effectively in the virtual environment is with a qualified instructor to guide them.  Practicing independently can result in a situation where students practice doing something WRONG, without anyone to redirect them.  Instructors need to be able to observe what students are doing in the virtual scene so that they can provide direction, correction, and guidance.  Given the space requirements, it would be really difficult for an instructor to be able to observe more than about 4-6 students at a time, so it makes sense for them to take turns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why Take Turns?</strong> Students cannot tolerate continuous VR use for 90 minutes.  They have to take breaks from the VR headset to avoid &ldquo;VR sickness&rdquo;.  See the segment in this document about <a href="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAR/pages/edit-v2/1253507086#VR-Safety-Considerations" rel="nofollow">VR Safety Considerations</a>.  Working in pairs or small groups allows students to learn through observation, while also building valuable teamwork and communication skills.</p></li></ul><p /><h1 id="InstructorGuideContentforSAR2.0-VRSafetyConsiderations">VR Safety Considerations</h1><p>Like most hands-on training opportunities in Community Services programs, the Search and Rescue 2.0 VR training simulation comes with some safety risks that we need to mitigate.  Overall, VR training is a very safe and enjoyable class for students and instructors, and we want to keep it that way!</p><h2 id="InstructorGuideContentforSAR2.0-VirtualRealitySickness"><span data-colorid="to2gbd9ghh">Virtual Reality Sickness</span></h2><p>About 20-50% of people are vulnerable to experiencing VR sickness.  The exact cause of these symptoms is not well known, but most sources agree that it is similar to motion sickness in terms of the symptoms and risk factors.  Here&rsquo;s what you you need to know:</p><h3 id="InstructorGuideContentforSAR2.0-WhataretheSymptomsofVRSickness"><span data-colorid="ijy0ki6f3m">What are the Symptoms of VR Sickness</span></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Headache </strong>and/or eye pain</p></li><li><p><strong>Nausea</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Vomiting</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Disorientation</strong>/light-headedness</p></li><li><p><strong>Vertigo</strong>, which may lead to falling</p></li><li><p>Paleness, pallor, unsteadiness, hand tremor</p></li><li><p>Symptoms can begin while playing VR or<strong> UP TO 20 MINUTES AFTERWARD</strong></p></li><li><p>The player may not be aware of the early onset of symptoms, because VR is so immersive and engaging that the student may not be paying attention to their body. This can cause the onset of symptoms to feel <strong>very sudden and severe</strong> for some users, because they are able to ignore milder symptoms without realizing it.</p></li></ul><h3 id="InstructorGuideContentforSAR2.0-WhoisatHighestRisk"><span data-colorid="n50hc4mxoi">Who is at Highest Risk</span></h3><ul><li><p>Anyone with a history of VR sickness or motion sickness (including amusement rides, car sickness, sea sickness) is at highest risk.</p></li><li><p>Anyone with recent history of concussion, no matter how mild or severe, no matter how caused.</p></li><li><p>Players of smaller or larger than average stature may be at higher risk. This is because the VR display is designed for an &ldquo;average&rdquo; sized male player, making the visual input less ideal for players that are significantly smaller or larger than average (considering both height and facial features dimensions).</p></li><li><p>Players with vision or hearing impairment that interferes with equal vision or hearing on both sides (e.g. blind in one eye, deaf in one ear) may be at higher risk.</p></li></ul><h3 id="InstructorGuideContentforSAR2.0-HowtoReducetheRisk"><span data-colorid="eteh6tf2fo">How to Reduce the Risk</span></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Exposure time is the key to preventing symptoms. </strong> Prevention is much more important than treatment, because symptoms are difficult to eliminate once they show up and more likely to recur in the future. We will STRICTLY limit the time new users spend in the headset to 10 minutes per evolution. We get the best results when players spend about an equal time recovering off headset in between each exposure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Acclimation</strong> takes time, but is very effective at preventing symptoms.  The more often a person uses VR without having symptoms, the more acclimated their nervous system becomes and the less likely it is that they will ever experience symptoms.  After the first couple of VR sessions, if all players are feeling good, we will become less strict about limiting play time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Immediate intervention</strong> is essential.  If a player begins to feel symptoms, they must immediately remove the headset and recover completely before attempting VR again.  There is no way to &ldquo;power through&rdquo; - this is not about toughness or perseverance.  </p></li><li><p>Headset use ends about <strong>10 minutes before class ends</strong>.  This provides essential time for debriefing and class discussion about the learning objectives covered, while also providing enough time for students to be sure that they are not having any late-onset symptoms.  We don&rsquo;t want your students to jump in the car and be travelling on the expressway at 100kph when they suddenly experience vertigo or disorientation!  We encourage students to monitor their own body and to observe their teammates for any signs of trouble.  Again, this becomes less strict after the first few weeks.</p></li></ul><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>Some people are more vulnerable to sensory overstimulation than others. <strong>VR sickness is not a weakness</strong>, and should never reflect on student performance in any way. It is an involuntary neurological effect.  Students that cannot tolerate VR training can still be excellent firefighters! We will work with them individually to ensure their comfort and equal access to learning.</p></div></div><h2 id="InstructorGuideContentforSAR2.0-PhysicalInjuryRisks"><span data-colorid="bc11jy12do">Physical Injury Risks</span></h2><p>In many ways, VR training carries one of the lowest risks to physical safety in the whole PSFF program, so it is certainly a low risk activity by comparison.  That being said, there are some risks of bodily injury that we try to mitigate in the VR training facility.</p><h3 id="InstructorGuideContentforSAR2.0-RiskofFalling"><span data-colorid="pqi0wkxm5w">Risk of Falling</span></h3><ul><li><p>Disorientation or entanglement in cords (when required) can result in players falling while participating in the VR simulation.</p></li><li><p>We use foam mats on the floor to minimize the risk of injury if a player should fall within the play area</p></li><li><p>Players are paired with a support person that is not wearing a headset so that the support person can ensure they stay within the designated play area and the cords/cables are kept out of their way.</p></li><li><p>Tripping hazards are minimized by requiring all jackets/backpacks/clothing to be kept in a safe location or stored in lockers in the corridor outside the VR room.</p></li></ul><h3 id="InstructorGuideContentforSAR2.0-AccidentalPhysicalContact"><span data-colorid="q5e9cy1vro">Accidental Physical Contact</span></h3><ul><li><p>It&rsquo;s important to recognize the fact that players in the VR headset cannot see anything in the real world, including the room that they are standing in and the people around them.  For this reason, there is always a risk of accidental physical contact.</p></li><li><p>Play areas are carefully arranged to minimize the risk of players making contact with furniture or walls. </p></li><li><p>Support persons are responsible to carefully supervise the player in the headset, to keep them well situated in the play area.  However, the support person may become so engrossed in watching the scenario on the monitor that they forget to supervise the player, and accidents can happen.</p></li><li><p>Support persons and instructors are reminded frequently to<strong> stay out of the reach of the player</strong> in the headset.  No matter how often we remind them, it may occur that the player in the headset could punch or touch a bystander accidentally.  Some of this type of contact has involved sensitive areas of the body, simply because players are often positioned down on the floor while support persons are usually standing up.  Personal safety is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility, but this risk is almost impossible to eliminate entirely in our limited space.</p></li></ul>
