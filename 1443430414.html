It is meant to be a 1:1 representation of the ideal stocking/locations for everything compared to the College’s real training ambulance. </p><p>The students are given two main play modes: Explore and “Seek &amp; Find”. In Explore mode students can explore every nook and cranny of the ambulance to find 100% of the items. There is no time limit or optimal path. In Seek &amp; Find mode students are challenged to complete a scenario where they locate all of the required equipment for a given simulated emergency. In Seek &amp; Find there are multiple scenarios for each of the three semesters of the program as well as various difficulties including time limits.</p><p>This DLX does not provide any assessment capabilities, nor return any grades to the LMS. At most the students may compete against themselves for personal best scores in Intermediate and Advanced Seek &amp; Find modes. </p><p><strong>DLX Objectives</strong> </p><p>The primary objective of the Ambulance Orientation DLX is to provide students with unlimited access to the ambulance, the various bags that are used in class, and a majority of the equipment for the whole program. Students can use this in a number of ways when access to the real equipment is either heavily scheduled or unavailable (after hours).</p><p>The Content is divided into two types: </p><p><strong>Explore Mode</strong>: The objective is to find 100% of the items presented on the checklist. Hints are allowed and the students can locate the items in any order they wish with no time limits.</p><p><strong>Seek &amp; Find Scenarios</strong>: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Beginner:</strong> For the given scenario, students have unlimited time and unlimited hints to locate everything they need. Additionally a list is provided. There is no personal best, but students do collect “completed” status for each scenario they finish.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intermediate: </strong>In intermediate mode the students still have unlimited hints and a checklist of the required items, but a count-down timer is also added. If the students complete the scenario before the timer expires they will earn both a “completed” status and a personal best time. If they complete the scenario faster in a subsequent time they will improve their personal best. If they fail to complete the scenario in a subsequent play they will NOT lose their “completed” status for that element.</p></li><li><p><strong>Advanced: </strong>In this hardest mode there is a timer, hints are removed, and the list is converted into a shopping-cart style list where the students submit their proposed set of equipment and it is evaluated against the master list of items. They may play this mode as frequently as they want and they can memorize the lists from Beginner or Intermediate mode if they wish. In our play testing and focus groups this mode was mostly used for “speed runs” where players competed for bragging rights. In Advanced mode there are also alternative allowable items for some requirements. For example, Larger gauze can substitute in for smaller (but no vice versa), or the long spine board can be used instead of the power stretcher.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Known Issues </strong></p><p>At the time of General Release (November 25, 2024) for Ambulance Orientation 1.0, the following low-impact issues were known to exist.  For each issue, a workaround is provided, to assist users who may encounter these issues when using the DLX. </p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-table-width="760" data-layout="default" data-local-id="ffe4dff3-9a1f-4e24-88aa-a837906bf50f" class="confluenceTable"><tbody><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#e8e8e8" class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Issue #</strong> </p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#e8e8e8" class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Description</strong> </p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#e8e8e8" class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Workaround</strong> or Discussion</p></td></tr><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#fae2d5" class="confluenceTd"><p>AMB-928</p><p>AMB-1023 </p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#fae2d5" class="confluenceTd"><p>Some smaller items (such as the micron filters or zip ties) overlap other components when exploding from bags, pockets or compartments.
