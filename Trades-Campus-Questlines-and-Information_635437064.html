                    <p>This live document is meant to function as a collection of information regarding the development of quests in the Trades Campus early on in development. This document will also feature potentially important information about the campus that could be used for quests.</p><p /><p>Wayfinding Quest: </p><p>The Trades Campus was designed to the opposite of Doon Campus. Instead of having many different services spread across the campus, everything is gathered near the main entrance. As such, the effectiveness of the Wayfinding quest is somewhat diminished. However, it still fulfills it’s desired purpose of teaching the students the major services in the opening area. So, currently the plan is to have the content simply be adjusted as is, though in the future we could add a few more objectives depending on whether we find certain facilities fit the narrative.</p><p /><p>Winter Quest: </p><p>The purpose of the Winter Quest is as follows: To teach international students how best to approach the Canadian Winters and the dangers therein, and to teach every student how to read and find classrooms. While the first objective is easy enough to translate over, the second is more difficult. There aren’t many standard classrooms in the Trades Campus and the ones they do have are all in the same hallway, which doesn’t fit the design of the game in terms of wayfinding. As for the other rooms, they’re all shops or labs, which would be fairly demanding to include all of them for the winter quest and having the player going inside these rooms could prove counter-productive as we don’t want to encourage students to walk into rooms they are not welcome in. </p><p>So, the solution is simply to have the winter quests appear in the “Student Lounges” of which there are five possible spots to pick from. Two of the portals will be found in classrooms in the single designated spot. The introduction will take place in the game room. While it is relatively small in comparison with other Conestoga gaming rooms, it fits our purposes.</p><p /><p>As for other possible quests: </p><p>The event room is used for many things. Many of the ones thus far have been employer events, marketing themselves to the students as potential employers. We were told that this has been the case currently because the Trades Campus is the most recent campus, so businesses look to have their events there. This will not always be the case though, and the layout may change from the auditorium setup it has not to something more communal. We were told it could become another lounge for students to relax in.</p><p /><p>There are student services and a quiet room that are not marketed very well right now. We could use the game as an opportunity to market these facilities. </p><p /><p>There will be indigenous services in the future, no timeline as of yet.</p><p /><p>Counselling is severely underutilized. There are a few proposed reasonings. The services aren’t marketed properly, they aren’t labelled properly on the maps, many students might not know what is offered exactly, perhaps because they’ve never been counselled before, or they’re from a country that doesn’t have it in the same way we do. Either way, this could be added in the future as a side quest.</p><p /><p>There are no electives that take place on the Trades Campus. Many of the courses are apprenticeships.</p><p /><p>There is an event hosted at the Trades campus called Jill of all Trades for women in high school or otherwise looking to go into a trade. We were told this was exclusive to women. This could pose a problem in representing the event as is, though this could easily be worked into dialogue.</p><p /><p>The Trades Awards is an awards ceremony for students where they are awarded for the work they’ve done. It’s not clear how often these awards are held.</p><p /><p>The campus hosts many of the same CSI events as other campuses.</p><p /><p />
