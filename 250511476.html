It was an assortment of notes all written by the team of three at the time. This document is a collection of that information as well as a way to document the design decisions in a more concise manner.</p><p>This document was written on June 7, 2021, the start of actual production on the project.</p><p><br/></p><p>Version 1.0 of this document was completed on June 9, 2021.</p><p /><p><br/></p><h1 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-1.GameOverview"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Game Overview</strong></h1><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-1.1ElevatorPitch"><strong>1.1 Elevator Pitch</strong></h2><p>Picture yourself arriving at a college campus for the first time, being greeted by a double set of doors that bring into a large room with many different paths to take. What do you do, where do you go? These are some of the questions that every new student has. What if there was an enjoyable way to help people find where they needed to be; a simple video game with recreations of these campuses.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-1.2Whatisthegame?"><strong>1.2 What is the game?</strong></h2><p>Conestoga RPG (working title) is a supplemental piece of edutainment designed to help new students pathfind their way through conestoga campuses, doon campus specifically. The game consists of a mission structure that has the player perform actions that a new student would take on their first few days of Conestoga. These missions lead into other missions creating a narrative.</p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-1.3ProjectImportance"><strong>1.3 Project Importance</strong></h2><p>Orientation can only do so much, and it doesn’t work for everyone. Taking a quick tour through the campus doesn’t mean that the student will know where they need to pick up their one card, or where the bookstore is, or even that they can pick up many supplies at the bookstore.</p><p>Of course, this all assumes that the student is even able to attend orientation. The goal is to allow people to play this game through their web browser or through their phone, making it so they don’t even need to be on campus to understand the layout.</p><p> </p><p /><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-1.4PathfindingandWaypointNavigation"><strong>1.4 Pathfinding and Waypoint Navigation</strong></h2><p>There are two main objectives with this project, first to allow players a virtual recreation of Conestoga that they are able to explore and familiarize themselves with. Second, to understand what it is they need to be successful in their studies.</p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-1.5Tone"><strong>1.5 Tone</strong></h2><p>The game’s writing and general tone will be happy and gleeful, an exaggerated version of what it’s actually like to attend. The dialogue will be comedic and overall lighthearted. The game needs to be positive so it can be enjoyed by everyone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h1 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-2.FeatureSet"><strong>2.</strong>               <strong>Feature Set</strong></h1><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-2.1GeneralFeatures"><strong>2.1 General Features</strong></h2><p>Complete recreation of Conestoga College Doon Campus within RPG Maker</p><p>2D sprite work</p><p>Interiors and Exteriors</p><p>A main quest with the most important information a new student needs to be successful at Conestoga</p><p>Side Quests that feature smaller information to build out the player’s knowledge, as well as the world the game takes place in</p><p>Humor both in character dialogue and object interaction</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><br/></p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-2.2Gameplay"><strong>2.2 Gameplay</strong></h2><p>The players will begin their journey in front of door 6 in the conestoga doon campus building. From there they will slowly be given more and more of the school to explore as they advance through the game.</p><p><strong>Main Quests </strong>are the most important part of the player’s journey. They’re the most obvious objectives, often spelled out to the player and usually involve them travelling from one location to another and talking with someone or performing a certain action. These are meant to be the most important things a new student would need to know about when they start at conestoga ie. getting a One Card or finding a classroom. Again, these will be obvious as everyone should be able to complete these.</p><p><strong>Side Quests</strong> act similarly to the main quests though these are obviously optional and not needed to complete the game. These also generally involve exploring, talking or collecting items. These are meant to subtly help people in the more lesser known functions at Conestoga. For example, one character walks up to the player and asks for help getting the key to the room they booked for a club. This helps the player know how they should get a club room while also promoting helping other students in need.</p><p><strong>Exploring the school</strong> is mostly what the player will be doing as they play through the campus RPG. Certain areas of the campus will be blocked off near the beginning to railroad the players into performing specific important objectives. Eventually the entire school will be available to them (the hallways and important rooms at least.) While every room might not be enterable, there will be space for them in the halls. The player will be able to find any room they need to through this game. There will also be smaller, more comical things the player can find by inspecting certain objects and talking with certain people.</p><p><strong>Combat Substitute</strong> is planned in some way. While we’re avoiding having actual combat since the game takes place in a real school, we can attempt to edit RPG Maker’s combat system to fall more in line with a conversation “battle.” Where, instead of choosing which type of attack you want to do, you’d choose what kind of words you’d want to say.</p><p><strong>Communities</strong> are a major component at Conestoga. From friends to clubmates, Conestoga actively tries to bring people together, and that’s something that will be reflected in the game. A hidden objective in the game will be to find all the companions.</p><h1 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-3.TheGameWorld"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>The Game World</strong></h1><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-3.1DoonCampusRecreation"><strong>3.1 Doon Campus Recreation</strong></h2><p>While the game will be used as a pathfinder for the school, it’s still a video game. As such, it would feel tedious if the player needed to walk in realistic steps to get from one destination to another. The player will be able to get from one end of the school to the other in less than a minute. Not only will this allow them to perform their in-game quests easier, it’ll help them identify their paths in real life that much quicker.</p><p>Again, every location in Conestoga will have a space within the game. A new student should be able to find any room in any point of the school.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-3.2Details"><strong>3.2 Details</strong></h2><p>The maps will be filled with small details like objects students and staff can find in real life. Many of these objects will be given flavour text to enrich the experience. Certain players will take more to this than others, but these will make the experience much more memorable and entertaining, thus remembering it more.</p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-3.3KeyLocations"><strong>3.3 Key Locations</strong></h2><p>Each and every one of Conestoga’s important locations will be represented in the game. Some of these locations include the Condor Nest, the BookStore, the Security Office and the library among many others. No location is unimportant, if one student might need it, it’s going in the game. The game needs to be completely accurate anyway, as if there’s one inconsistency, who knows how many others there’ll be.</p><p>Not every room, however, will be built completely. For example, Room 2C06 is not a very intricate room to navigate and the room beside it, 2C03, is more or less the same room. While it wouldn’t be hard to have them navigate to the same map, there isn’t much of a point. As long as there is space in the hallway outside, and the player is able to know where room 2C06 or 2C03 is, then it’s mission accomplished.</p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-3.4Travel"><strong>3.4 Travel</strong></h2><p>The player will walk from place to place both inside the college and the immediate exterior. To traverse to different campuses, the player will talk to a bus driver and choose which campus they want to visit.</p><p> </p><p><br/></p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-3.5Layout"><strong>3.5 Layout</strong></h2><p>To make the campus seem less intricate, each wing of the building is separated into its own map. This is done to make it clear to the player that they’ve transitioned to a new part of the building with its own unique features. Using this method, it’ll highlight the idea that the large campus is just built of multiple smaller sections, making it feel much less overwhelming. This is only not the case with A building second floor, as it is much larger than any of the other wings. It is separated into two maps.</p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-3.6Scale"><strong>3.6 Scale</strong></h2><p>The game is not 1:1 to real life. It is designed to match the JRPG style that the engine is designed for. As such, the hallways will be shrunk down to allow for easier traversal, and characters will appear larger.</p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-3.7Objects"><strong>3.7 Objects</strong></h2><p>The game is designed as an RPG, but with much less complex systems. The many different objects in the game are separated into different categories. These are consumables, key items and decorations.</p><p><strong>Consumables</strong> enter the player’s inventory and are usable by the player to gain various effects. These will mostly be used as supplemental objectives. These items can be purchased at many different vendors, from the book store, Tim Hortons, and vending machines among others.</p><p><strong>Key Items</strong> are more important to the player’s advancement of stories or secrets. These cannot be used and will have various purposes in the game, from offering new interactions with people to unlocking new quests. These are obtained by various means, often through exploration or story progression.</p><p><strong>Decorations</strong> are anything the player cannot collect but can interact with. These are the main source of flavour text in the game and are meant to enhance the experience.</p><p>For a full list of objects see the object appendix at the end of the document.</p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-3.8Perspective"><strong>3.8 Perspective</strong></h2><p>The game will be facing (somewhat) northward in relation to the real campus. This will make it easier for the player to adapt to the real life environment as that will be how they see the college. To accommodate for rooms and areas the player can’t see, small objects will be placed to show that there’s something there. It will be dependant on the specific location, rooms will be signified with</p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-3.9Lighting"><strong>3.9 Lighting</strong></h2><p>For the most part, there won’t be any unique lighting effects. Realistically, there’s no point, however in some areas, it could benefit. In certain areas the player can’t access like the loading bay, it might be beneficial to use lights to darken that area. When the player goes outside, there can be little pockets of light that peer through the trees.</p><p> </p><h1 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-4.Tools"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Tools</strong></h1><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-4.1RPGMaker"><strong>4.1 RPG Maker</strong></h2><p>The game will be built using RPG Maker MZ, the latest iteration of the software. It’s designed specifically to build old-school JRPGs with ease, doing most of the coding work behind the scenes. Using it helps speed development time as most of the development is building the maps and events.</p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-4.2Aseprite"><strong>4.2 Aseprite</strong></h2><p>A dedicated pixel-based software, aseprite is the perfect choice for building characters, objects and tiles for RPG Maker.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p /><h1 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-5.GameCharacters"><strong>5. Game Characters</strong></h1><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-5.1Protagonist"><strong>5.1 Protagonist</strong></h2><p>Ideally the goal is to have a character creator so that each and every player can customize their appearance and see themselves within the game. As this would take an immense amount of dev time, for version 1 of this project, the player will take control of the school’s mascot, the condor.</p><p>This skips over the need of different art assets as well as gives a more humorous take on the game’s narrative. The condor, having been at conestoga for so long, decides to finally take a class. Of course, they need to perform the duties that a new student first attending would need to.</p><p>The player cannot customize anything about their character aside from the name, which by default is Condor.</p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-5.2NPCs"><strong>5.2 NPCs</strong></h2><p>Campus RPG is filled with NPCs, from students to faculty. Most of these characters will be made through RPG Maker’s character creator to save time.</p><p> </p><p>Each character has their own dialogue and locations that are subject to change depending on certain events that take place in the game. Many NPCs will also move around their space to give more life to the scene.</p><p> </p><p>Only important characters that the player meets throughout either multiple story quests or multiple side missions will be given a portrait. While every character made within RPG Maker has a portrait, it’s important that the player is able to discern who is important and who isn’t.</p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-5.3PartyMembers"><strong>5.3 Party Members</strong></h2><p>Through many different circumstances, certain characters can join you as party members (or friends). This can unlock new dialogue with NPCs, side quests or main quests. They’ll follow behind the player and make comments on certain actions or scenarios.</p><p> </p><h1 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-6.UserInterface"><strong>6. User Interface</strong></h1><p>Campus RPG will use the general UI found within RPG Maker, modelled after SNES Final Fantasy games. It’s too time intensive to create a new UI when it plays such a small part in the overall experience. The only differences are the names given to certain fields, like the character class being Conestoga Student.</p><p> </p><h1 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-7.MusicandSFX"><strong>7. Music and SFX</strong></h1><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-7.1SoundDesign"><strong>7.1 Sound Design</strong></h2><p>All of the songs and sound effects originate from RPG Maker. Many of the songs emanate a joyful and happy attitude which is the exact style we want. General ambience includes muffled voices throughout the halls as well as doors opening/closing and footsteps whenever the player changes areas.</p><p>More sound effects will be added during cutscenes to emphasize character reactions similarly to how the music will change.</p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-7.2SoundEffects"><strong>7.2 Sound Effects</strong></h2><p>Throughout the school, the player can hear the muffled voices of other students. This is used with “people 1” at 5% volume so as to not overpower the music. In theory, the sounds of the students increase in volume as the player enters certain areas. Conversely, it stops during others.</p><p><br/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h1 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-8.Single-PlayerExperience"><strong>8. Single-Player Experience</strong></h1><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-8.1Story"><strong>8.1 Story</strong></h2><p>You play as the Condor, the mascot of Conestoga. After years of seeing students come and go, they’ve decided to become a student themselves. They find themselves at the beginning of orientation and need to get set up to be as successful as possible.</p><p>They continue to build experience as a student, overcoming obstacles and meeting new people.</p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-8.2PlayTime"><strong>8.2 PlayTime</strong></h2><p>Completing the “main story” shouldn’t be a very long experience. Students' lives are busy enough as is and this game is meant to ease them into their new life as a student. An average playthrough of going straight through all the main quests should take around 30-45 minutes. All of the most important information will be given to the player efficiently.</p><p>Side quests and exploration, however, will increase playtime by an unknown amount. It’ll all depend on how much supplemental content we add and how much the player is willing to do. Again, these quests don’t offer as important of information but serves to better increase their knowledge of the college.</p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-8.3VictoryConditions"><strong>8.3 Victory Conditions</strong></h2><p>The game is very linear, as the player finishes one main quest, they’ll unlock the next and the process repeats until the final quest. Once they complete the final quest, the game will end. Of course, the player is allowed to keep playing, to complete any side quests they missed as well as explore the school more</p><p> </p><h2 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-8.4Progression"><strong>8.4 Progression</strong></h2><p>The player “progresses” in more than one way. They progress through the game’s story by completing each main quest. They progress through the school by playing through the main quests and unlocking more sections of the school.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h1 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-CharacterAppendix"><strong>Character Appendix</strong></h1><ol><li><p>Condor (Protagonist)</p></li><li><p>President Tibbits</p></li></ol><p> </p><h1 id="GameDesignDocument(FieldPlacement2021version)-ObjectsAppendix"><strong>Objects Appendix</strong></h1><p> <strong>Interactable</strong></p><p /><p><strong>Items Appendix</strong></p><p><strong>Key Items</strong></p><ul><li><p>One Card</p></li><li><p>Supplies</p></li><li><p>Room Key</p></li><li><p>Certificate of Coolness</p></li></ul><p><strong>Consumables</strong></p><ul><li><p>Pencils </p></li><li><p>Binder</p></li><li><p>Textbook</p></li><li><p>Chips</p></li><li><p>Sodie Pop</p></li></ul><p><strong>Equippable</strong></p><ul><li><p>Condor Sweater</p></li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Main Quest Appendix</strong></p><ol><li><p>One Card Quest</p></li></ol><p><strong>Synopsis: </strong>At the beginning of the game, the player enters through door three and realizes that the first thing they must do is get their one card.
