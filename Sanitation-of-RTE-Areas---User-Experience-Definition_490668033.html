This page describes the user experience for both branded and generic modules.</p><h3 id="SanitationofRTEAreas-UserExperienceDefinition-InitialLoad">Initial Load</h3><p>On initial load, the scene will open on a 360 skybox view of the lobby or entrance of the meat processing facility.  A welcome message will be displayed, as well as a voiceover greeting.  At minimum, the welcome message must confirm the module name and briefly describe the purpose and scope of this module, so that the learner knows they have launched the right DLS module.</p><p>&lt;image - mockup of opening scene&gt;</p><h3 id="SanitationofRTEAreas-UserExperienceDefinition-Introduction">Introduction</h3><p>The user needs an overview of what will be covered in this module.  At bare minimum, this would just be a list of topics (probably with nested sub-topics) that are arranged in the order that the learner will encounter them.  Ideally, the overview will help the learner identify exactly WHAT they are about to learn, WHY they need to know this information, and HOW they are expected to interact with the DLS to succeed at this training.</p><p>At high level, this module will satisfy the following learning objectives:</p><ol><li><p>What is Sanitation? - Cleaning (removing soils) + Sanitizing (removing biological hazards) </p></li><li><p>Why is sanitation important?  Reduce contamination hazards, product and employee safety</p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="ttl7sny145">Where to sanitize - Utensils, Food Contact Surfaces, Non-Food Contact surfaces - this will be covered under Why is sanitation important (surfaces that become contaminated must be sanitized)</span></p></li><li><p>Wet vs Dry Sanitation - BRIEFLY cover the difference between these two processes, and provide at least one example of when each would be used. Use the source material in the SharePoint workspace, in the PPT titled &ldquo;<a class="external-link" href="https://stuconestogacon.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/VARLab/ERZVvljERDFHhxxGtFbY9cABLdDbYW4s2378vkAO9vwG-A?e=BRzNnb" rel="nofollow">Sanitation of RTE Areas-IN PROGRESS.pptx</a>&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>What are the steps of wet sanitation, and a minigame to practice this skill</p></li></ol><h3 id="SanitationofRTEAreas-UserExperienceDefinition-ModuleContent">Module Content</h3><p>This module will follow a pattern of EXPLAIN-SHOW-DO that will allow the learner to be introduced to new content, and then understand how to apply that knowledge through demonstration, followed by an opportunity to practice their new skill or knowledge right away in an interactive activity.</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="co4x77oth3">EXPLAIN</span></strong></p><p>Through the use of info panels and/or embedded video, the voiceover will explain what sanitation is and why it is essential to food safety.
