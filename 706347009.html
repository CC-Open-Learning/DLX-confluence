For each of these modules, there will be lecture, followed approx 1 week later by the in-person skills lab related to that lecture. Students are expected to use the 6 days between the lecture and the skills lab to practice the project and gain confidence.

At that usability testing event, the DLX was crashing, slow, lagging, and students were unable to play it on the college-supplied laptops that were used.  These are the laptops that are intended as the target platform for this project, and they are the same laptops (equivalent) to what was used at the Nov 2024 student focus group.  We did not test this demo build against student-grade hardware, because we had a false sense of confidence based on the previous focus group.  Something that we&rsquo;ve changed in the DLX since Nov 2024 is killing performance on the target student hardware, and we didn&rsquo;t notice.</p></li><li><p>Other usability issues were raised at the focus group as well, mainly about students being unable to play due to lack of guidance or knowing what to do.  We had some similar feedback at the Nov 2024 group, and added user prompts and instructions into the DLX workflow that we thought would help, but these measures were not adequate. </p></li><li><p>Stacey immediately reached out to the CE to apologize for the incident and take responsibility for what happened.  He was gracious.  Even so, it was a moment to take accountability, and demonstrate actions that will correct this issue and make sure it doesn&rsquo;t happen again.</p></li><li><p>The team is currently gathering more information about what happened so that we can investigate and hopefully identify and correct the high priority issues very quickly.</p></li><li><p>It is unclear at this time if the work needed to correct the performance and usability issues will require a change to the project timeline, or if we can somehow resolve these issues in the time we have left before our target GR date.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><time datetime="2025-01-21" class="date-past">21 Jan 2025</time> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>As predicted, the recent surge in workflow user stories being completed has pushed this project over the hump, and we are now back on track for a target delivery in mid-March 2025.

We will continue to work toward demo-focused sprint plans in the W25 term, as we finish up the final student workflow tasks and turn our focus to usability and project-level requirements such as:</p><ul><li><p>Save &amp; Load</p></li><li><p>Analytics</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Full scale workflow testing and bug-fixing in preparation for GR can begin as soon as the remaining functional requirements are met, this is planned for 25W4 - 6.  GR testing will follow the same approach used by AMB and PHI.</p></li><li><p>Student focus group is planned for Fri Jan 17th, in hopes of collecting student feedback on the nearly-complete workflow.  We do not expect to find anything really critical during that testing, but we might be able to smooth and polish the workflow a bit as we move closer to GR.</p></li><li><p>Pending the successful implementation of the remaining student workflow tasks, I am hoping to move this project back into &ldquo;green&rdquo; status for Phase 3 of development.  If we are confident that we can be Feature Complete by the end of 25W3 (or 25W4 at the latest), we will be on track for Mar 2025 GR target.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><time datetime="2024-11-27" class="date-past">27 Nov 2024</time> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>Sprint 24F6 shows a big jump in tickets completed, but the scope is a bit misleading because a number of &ldquo;As a learner&hellip;&rdquo; user stories were closed, but there is no user-facing functionality implemented.  Reading the sprint scope, you have the impression that you can do all of the following things (but you can&rsquo;t - only backend dev work was done for these workflows so far):</p><ul><li><p>Select a device (for each of Fan, Light, Outlet, Light Switch, Fan Switch, Circuit Breaker) and see it in the scene for you to start connecting it</p></li><li><p>See the breaker panel in the basement</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Lots of valuable work was done, but there is very little to demo.</p></li><li><p>We will revise the issue summaries and descriptions for the 24F6 user stories so that they can stay in the sprint and retain their status of Done, but they need to describe the work that was actually done (mostly As a developer&hellip; backend stuff).  This will resolve the issue of expectations not matching the demo for 24F6, then we need to create new user stories for the implementation of the user-facing workflows in the DLX, so that we can track that work for a future sprint.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><time datetime="2024-10-24" class="date-past">24 Oct 2024</time> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>Sprint 24F4 ended with 24 tickets completed (2 art, 22 dev).</p><ul><li><p>2 art tickets - minor asset revisions for Terminate Conductors workflow</p></li><li><p>14 bug tickets - mostly UI text fixes or add/replace UI images</p></li><li><p>8 story tickets - 6 were &ldquo;As a developer&rdquo; tickets, 2 were &ldquo;As a learner&rdquo; tickets</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Conversations with VLT have helped us to arrive at some difficult compromises in hopes of delivering this DLX on time:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Many animations will be very simplified or cut entirely. </strong> The animations were intended to provide some passive learning value by showing a brief example of how the manual/tangible work would look.  We currently have a placeholder animation for mounting boxes that is intended to enhance immersion and possibly act as a reminder of the types of tools and techniques that are used for this work at the job site.  The fact is that we will not have time to do most of these animations, and they are not providing any significant learning value. Students need to learn hands-on skills in the skills lab (how to use a drill, how to run cables, how to terminate conductors), not in the DLX.  The highest-value animations can be prioritized if we have time for them, but all other animations will be cut from scope.  We can always come back and uplift the project in a future project.</p></li><li><p><strong>All existing game mechanics and UI elements must be re-used in their existing form, without further optimization or customization.</strong> This could result in some limitations for future workflows such as Select &amp; Install Devices, particularly for outliers like the Exhaust Fan or the Breaker, but we will need to accept those limits and make it work without introducing any new or adapted interactions, and without relying on animations to fill in the gaps.  This was mostly already what was planned for the upcoming feature implementations, so it&rsquo;s really just a good reminder to resist the urge to tinker or optimize.</p></li><li><p>The biggest ingredient in ending the do-redo-redo again cycle that we are stuck in is going to be <strong>reducing opportunities for change</strong>.  Our CE is excellent and wants the very best for this DLX, but he has had a tough time settling down on one right answer in many of our workflows.  In many cases, even though the existing workflow is correct and works, he requests an even better version - more realistic lighting fixture, different order of terminating conductors in the gang box for rough-in.  Stacey is going to work directly with this CE to minimize temptation to revise and optimize task options or order of steps, unless a critical mistake has been made and the workflow is WRONG.  This is a big challenge for us, because our usual practice is to follow the lead of the CE and implement what they ask for.  Due to project constraints, we need to be able to push back and respectfully decline any new requests from our CE on this project, unless they are critical bugs.  </p></li><li><p><strong>Collect feedback without adding scope.</strong> All bugs reported in playtesting or focus group testing will go to the backlog for consideration in a future project, unless they are critical bugs.  Stacey will review critical bugs with VLT to determine priority, nothing goes into scope without review.</p></li><li><p>Starting from Sprint 24F5, we will <strong>deprioritize further refactoring, technical redesign, or code health requirements</strong> in favour of user-facing features and workflows.  In spite of knowing how valuable long-term code health and systems are, we have exhausted the amount of time that we can invest in this project for those valid goals.  We are trying to strike a balance between a stable, serviceable product and delivering the product as per our commitment.  We need to be able to apply our best coding practices moving forward, and not lose any ground.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>With these directions in mind, the term goal for this project is to complete the full project workflow (including save &amp; load, settings, feedback, all user-facing features) by the end of 24F7 (Dec 06).  During the intersession, we can address any lingering concerns about code health or product quality, then attack the remaining workflow steps for Final inspection and all remaining GR requirements (Analytics, Promo video, etc) in the 25W term.  Depending on how quickly we can implement those requirements, we can prioritize bugs in the backlog and other high value user-facing enhancements such as animations as time &amp; resources permit.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><time datetime="2024-10-16" class="date-past">16 Oct 2024</time> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>Recent progress brings this project near the end of Phase I, with almost all major systems and user interactions in place.

I will request the phase change from VLT when we are sure that we&rsquo;ve completed the Terminate Wires workflow successfully.</p></li><li><p>Sprint velocity remains an elusive target for this team, but the quality of the work is evidenced by the significant reduction in new issues reported each sprint, especially from the CE demos. </p></li><li><p>We will continue working to improve the sprint velocity for this project, now that  the refactoring is completed.  Here is a quick review of sprint metrics for the Fall 24 sprints to date, looking at Story and Bug tickets closed per sprint:<br />TE F24-1: 23 tickets<br />TE F24-2: 27 tickets<br />TE F24-3: 28 tickets<br />TE F24-4 (planned as of today): 14 tickets <br />Our target continues to be the &ldquo;VARLab standard&rdquo; of 1 ticket per day per FT dev (where DNA members count as 0.5 due to other responsibilities). For the TE team at present, that target would translate to 4 x 8 development days in a typical sprint = 48 tickets per sprint.  The team recognizes that ticket size/points are significant factors in this measurement and are encouraged to try to split tickets as needed to help ensure that most stories or bugs could be completed in approx 1 day, this is not always possible.  We are working on it, this continues to be an area where we want to improve.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><time datetime="2024-09-18" class="date-past">18 Sep 2024</time> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>I provided an update to VLT via Teams chat (VLT-CONFIDENTIAL) as follows:</p><ul><li><p>This is our first production sprint with David, and already (3 days into it) we are seeing huge benefits</p></li><li><p>Sprint Planning has been significantly upgraded to include individual story/ticket review and pointing.

Ask for more details about anything, but I don&rsquo;t want to write a book in this update!</p></li><li><p>Code refactoring to maximize reusability.  Now that our Figma UI design is complete and we know there will be no further planned changes, it&rsquo;s time to make sure that all of the UXML templates are consolidated and fully up to date. Reviewing the class diagram and making adjustments based on what we have learned in Phase I dev, Amila is working to bring everything into the best and cleanest condition possible for the start of F24 term.</p></li><li><p>Team size is temporarily being trimmed to only 3 FT co-op devs, plus David and Amila.  Keeping a slightly smaller team for a few sprints will help trim up processes (particularly around PRs) so that we can actually increase velocity.  We will begin the F24 term with a target of 32 tickets per sprint (1 ticket per day per co-op dev, plus 0.5 ticket per day per each DNA lead).  As the term progresses, we expect to welcome 2-3 more co-op developers (pending availability) to further enhance our velocity.</p></li><li><p>Some new process enhancements through VLT will also help us to deliver more efficient and reliable progress, with less rework.  </p><ul><li><p>UI Texts will be sourced from a consolidated Script document in SharePoint, and not copied from other sources like Figma, Jira, or Confluence (and NOT composed by development).  The UI Texts will be easy to find (organized by task and by use case) and will be clearly identified as draft vs final text, so that devs will always be able to copy final text for use in the DLX from one reliable source, owned by the Instructional Designer (Katrina). This is expected to dramatically reduce the number of text-fix tickets that we&rsquo;ve been facing in the previous term by making sure that everyone knows where to find and how to use the approved UI texts. </p></li><li><p>The PR Checklist is a collaborative effort led by Balazs with the DNA team to bring greater consistency and clear success criteria to the code review process for all projects.  The goal is for devs to ensure their code is ready for review using the checklist, and DNA to efficiently confirm that the PR meets expectations before merging. This will reduce the frequency of changes being requested on PRs and reduce the amount of time spent on PR&rsquo;s by DNA leads by making sure the work is ready for review before it is submitted for review.</p></li></ul></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><time datetime="2024-08-08" class="date-past">08 Aug 2024</time> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>CE Tom Mulder communicated that the Trades Electrical programs will be switching from the 2021 version of the Canadian Electrical Code to the 2024 version starting in Sept 2024.

Tom expressed that the problem will be finding class time - he talked about lab time where some students finish the lab early and maybe we could work with those students?

Instead of selecting wire placement from 2D images in the task menu, the student will work in the 3D scene, in a special close-up view at each box.  The primary objective for this change is to get the student doing more of their work in the 3D scene instead of being stuck in the 2D menu all the time.</p></li><li><p>The click-connect interaction will be similar to the one used in MPC, where the student would select a lead and place it on the trainer board by selecting the connection ports.  In TE, there is no board, so we will provide connection options using the familiar yellow orb that was used to mark locations for mounting boxes in the Select &amp; Mount Boxes workflow.  Also, in MPC the learner had to connect both ends of the lead to the trainer board, but in TE there is only 1 end of the wire that needs to be connected.  </p></li><li><p>To complete each task, the learner will select a wire (wire will highlight) to see connection options for that wire.  Connection options are described in this document <a class="external-link" href="https://stuconestogacon.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/VARLab/EdaxqT38TBRHvxi4pFEpp0ABO8zA92UJi0Kp4p5GEDFYeg?e=z9ZZza" rel="nofollow">TE Scenario 1 &ndash; Supply Cable Task Options and Feedback.docx</a> in the Terminate Wires in Boxes section.

This immediate feedback can use the same feedback UI that is used for other tasks (e.g. immediate feedback when selecting supply cable). </p></li><li><p>Unlike MPC, we do not need the wire to have any physics - it will not follow the mouse cursor to &ldquo;stretch&rdquo; to the selected destination.

It is expected that each student will play through the project at least once during that 6 days, to help them prepare for the skills lab.</p></li><li><p>Students will spend approx 1 hour to play through once, but this cannot be straight playtime because the student needs to stop and look things up in the code as they go. Not sure exactly how long the student needs to look things up, but maybe we&rsquo;ll <strong>target around 45min of playtime or less</strong> to complete the project once from beginning to end. This will include any required time in tutorial, as well as adequate time to receive and respond to project feedback (fix mistakes). Obviously, there will be some variation in play time depending on how many mistakes/do overs the student needs, but at least we have a target.</p></li><li><p>Students will play the DLX outside of class and will not have an instructor present for guidance or questions during the play-through.  They are not expected to work in groups and the DLX activity will not be taken up in class.  The only feedback they will get about their practice project in the DLX is the in-game feedback.</p></li><li><p>Students may choose to play through the DLX as often as they want, including returning to the DLX after moving on to a new project, but its primary value is to prepare students for the skills lab.
