                    <h2 id="DoonKeyMomentsforWaterloo-FindingAFriend"><strong>Finding A Friend</strong></h2><p>In this quest, the player (The Condor) must find a companion to journey through Conestoga with. They meet Ezra near Door 3, who needs help finding the library. He needs to print off a form and hand it to security. The specific form Ezra is printing off is never specified, nor is it said why he needs to give it to security. </p><p>The major beats of this quest are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>The player is introduced to an immediate goal relatively close to the entrance.</p></li><li><p>It highlights the help desk, which students can use if they need general information about the campus (it also acts as a method of giving the player explicit directions).</p></li><li><p>The player learns where the library is.</p></li><li><p>The player finds the printer room and learns that they can print papers in the library (and where they’ll be printed).</p></li><li><p>The player finds the security desk, located conveniently close to the library.</p></li></ul><p>This quest is also designed to restrict player movement while giving them some room to explore. In the beginning, only A Wing is accessible, but halfway through, the player must go to B Wing. Only the second floor is available for these wings in this quest. The player also has the option to begin the Winter Quest during this quest, as The Den is also located in the second floor of A Wing.</p><p /><h2 id="DoonKeyMomentsforWaterloo-Lunch"><strong>Lunch</strong></h2><p>In this quest, The Condor and Ezra are feeling hungry so they decide to visit the Cafeteria. The Condor and Ezra go down to the first floor and find the cafeteria too busy for their liking. They remember hearing about the CozE corner and decide to go there instead. They find it, buy their lunch, then they sit and talk in the CozE Corner. </p><p>The major beats of the quest are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>The player learns the location and size of the cafeteria.</p></li><li><p>The player finds the CozE corner, an interesting alternative to the cafeteria exclusive to Doon Campus.</p></li><li><p>The player learns where to purchase food from the CozE corner.</p></li></ul><p>This quest opens up the first floor of the campus, though only A Wing and B Wing until the player finds the cafeteria. After this, all of the college is open for the player to explore as they can finally participate in their first side quest.</p><p /><h2 id="DoonKeyMomentsforWaterloo-StudentEngagement"><strong>Student Engagement</strong></h2><p>This is a simple quest that really only involves The Condor and Ezra going to the Student Engagement offices in A Wing. Inside, they find Asmee, a new party member, and learn about Student Engagment.</p><p>The major beats are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Learn where the Student Engagement office is located.</p></li><li><p>Learn what some of the opportunities SE offers to students as well as the Conestoga Ready app. This was in-part with Student Engagement as they offered their office to be a location in the game’s main story and told us some of the things they’d like highlighted. Student Engagement is included as a major Conestoga service to be shown.</p></li></ul><p>This quest is a very simple one-scene quest. It opens the Student Engagement office (and closes it afterward) as well as give the player a new party member.</p><p /><p /><h2 id="DoonKeyMomentsforWaterloo-TheBookStore"><strong>The Book Store</strong></h2><p>This is another simple quest (and the final one for the Wayfinding quest technically) that tasks the player with finding the Book Store in A Wing and obtaining their books.</p><p>The major beats are as such:</p><ul><li><p>Learn the confusing layout of A Wing’s class hallways and where to find the Book Store.</p></li><li><p>Learn to purchase and pick up necessary school supplies. (This may need to be revisited as the Book Store is still under renovation and shipping + receiving may be changed.)</p></li><li><p>This quest visually advertises some of the items and merch that can be purchased at the book store.</p></li></ul><p>There is nothing particularly special about the quest, aside from the extra scene that plays if the player has completed the Winter Quest at this point.</p><p /><h2 id="DoonKeyMomentsforWaterloo-TheWinterQuest"><strong>The Winter Quest</strong></h2><p>This will be a grouped description. The Winter Quest tasks the player with investigating the mystical winter portals showing up all over campus. The quest begins in the A Wing during the Finding a Friend quest. They  get pointed towards the direction of The Den, where the quest starts proper. The only other interesting location is the TV Studio on the first floor of B Wing. The rest of the portals can be found in classrooms, unlocked by completing the previous winter portal.</p><p>The Winter quest is designed to be an international student’s introduction to a Canadian Winter and the dangers that come with it. During the quest, they learn all of the major clothes they need to prepare for Winter.</p><p>The major story beats are as follows.</p><ul><li><p>The player is approached by Old Man Winter, a mysterious entity of winter. The Condor is told they must prepare for the coming winter and to do so, they must journey to The Den.</p></li><li><p>The Condor learns where The Den is and what they can do inside, as well as gain a new party member.</p></li><li><p>The Condor obtains gloves, is told the importance of keeping your hands warm and enters the portal. They lose the encounter against Winston the Snowman.</p></li><li><p>After Winston the Snowman, the Condor is given a general overview of Winter, including the harsh cold, frostnip and frostbite. Old Man Winter arrives once more telling the Condor to collect five more pieces of winterwear before challenging the cold of Winston again.</p></li><li><p>The player enters 1B24, the TV Studio and learns what a Parka is. They encounter the cold of Octobrrr and overcome it.</p></li><li><p>The player enters 1F12 and learns about Toques. They encounter the cold of Frostnip and overcome it.</p></li><li><p>The player enters 3E14 and learns the importance of boots. They encounter the cold of Ice Cube (not the rapper though this one does have a blooming career in music too).</p></li><li><p>The player enters 2C18 and learns the importance of scarves. They encounter the cold of Frostbite and overcome it.</p></li><li><p>The player enters 1D20 and learns the importance of Snow Pants. They encounter the cold of Hypothermia and overcome it.</p></li><li><p>The Condor’s party return to The Den with the winter clothes and knowledge they need and overcome Winston the Snowman. Old Man Winter congratulates them.</p></li></ul><h2 id="DoonKeyMomentsforWaterloo-ThePond"><strong>The Pond</strong></h2><p>After completing the Wayfinding quest and the Winter quest, the party decide they want to reflect on their day at Conestoga and decide to do it at the Pond. The pond was chosen as a unique location to Doon campus as well as a calming setting for the final scene of the main story.</p><p>The major story beats are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>The party decides to go to the pond accessible from B Wing.</p></li><li><p>The group reflects on what they’ve done (the game reflects this too by having the characters from completed side quests appear here as well). They all talk about their programs and how excited they are to learn. The game then ends.</p></li></ul><p>This will most likely be changed as the new campus is available. Currently, the game gives the player the option to continue playing, or see the credits. One option is to play the credits, then once they’re completed, they’re told that a new campus is open to them and they can access it by talking with Kaedama (in Doon campus’ case). Then being teleported to the bus stops.</p><p /><h2 id="DoonKeyMomentsforWaterloo-Avi’sONECard"><strong>Avi’s ONECard</strong></h2><p>This sidequest tasks the player with finding Avi’s missing ONECard. It teaches them what they should do in the event they lose their ONECard and tests their knowledge of the campus.</p><p>The major story beats are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>The player talks with Avi in the cafeteria and overhears him talking about his lost ONECard. He says he’ll look for his old one before freezing it and ordering a new one online.</p></li><li><p>Avi goes to search in The Pit in A Wing, this is a simple way to introduce the player to The Pit in Doon.</p></li><li><p>Avi goes to search in The Agora in F Wing, this similarly is meant to introduce the player to The Agora in Doon.</p></li><li><p>Avi finally goes to his classroom in F Wing where his ONECard is. This is another test to make sure the player can navigate to their destination based on room numbers (this was made before the Winter Quest which also serves a similar purpose).</p></li></ul><p /><h2 id="DoonKeyMomentsforWaterloo-TheClayStatues"><strong>The Clay Statues</strong></h2><p>A mysterious clay statue is found atop a locker in B Wing. The player finds the owner of the statue before going on a quest to find two more statues and solve the mystery.</p><p>The major story beats are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>The player finds the clay statue in B Wing (located on the way to a Winter Quest room, making sure the player at least sees it.)</p></li><li><p>Jillian, the owner is found in the CozE corner, another method of reminding the player where to find the CozE corner.</p></li><li><p>The player finds a second clay statue in the halls of A Wing and again in E wing. These are meant to serve as the player’s reason to search the areas of campus they otherwise wouldn’t.</p></li><li><p>Once they find the statues, they go to the designated locker of the creator of the statues and learn that it was meant to be a birthday surprise for Jillian. This quest ends in a wholesome fashion, showing the friendship between two students.</p></li></ul><p>The statues must be picked up in order, perhaps that should be changed.</p><h2 id="DoonKeyMomentsforWaterloo-Barty’sCane"><strong>Barty’s Cane</strong></h2><p>This quest involves helping the character Barty get to the second floor of campus using the elevators as they can’t use the stairs during the quest. </p><p>The major story beats are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>The player finds Barty in front of the CozE corner, after interacting with them, they temporarily join the party and the player must find the elevators.</p></li><li><p>The player uses the closest elevator to Barty’s location at the start of the quest, and get to use it to get up to the second floor.</p></li><li><p>The party finds Barty’s locker and they’re able to get their cane. The Condor and Barty talk about the uses of the elevators and the Condor gets the ability to use the elevators after completing the quest.</p></li></ul><h2 id="DoonKeyMomentsforWaterloo-GettingtheBandTogether"><strong>Getting the Band Together</strong></h2><p>In this quest, The Condor must find two other band members for Seamus' band. The Condor finds Jemima and Ruth in the Cafeteria and CozE corner respectively. Afterward, the Condor must find the work room they’re holding their first meeting. </p><p>The major story beats are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>The player finds Seamus in C Wing on the first floor and promises to find two band members.</p></li><li><p>The player must find Jemima and Ruth, this is another example of offering the player a reason to explore the campus.</p></li><li><p>After returning to Seamus, the Condor is told to go to the work room. This is to teach the player where the work rooms are in the campus and that students can book time in these rooms.</p></li></ul><p /><h2 id="DoonKeyMomentsforWaterloo-TechTroubles"><strong>Tech Troubles</strong></h2><p>The player must help Madeline get a laptop on short notice as she forgot hers at home. The player must find the Tech Hub as you can rent laptops and other such technology from them.</p><p>The major story beats are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>The player finds Madeline in D Wing on the first floor and offers to help see if they can get a laptop anywhere on Campus.</p></li><li><p>The Condor finds the Tech Hub where students can rent certain items such as laptops. This is to promote the tech hub and the services it offers. This quest was built more so to add more content to the game and promote a facility rather than thinking in terms of the specific issues that the Tech Hub can help with.</p></li></ul><h2 id="DoonKeyMomentsforWaterloo-TheCondor’sNest"><strong>The Condor’s Nest</strong></h2><p>In this quest, The Condor offers to help Asmee’s friend, Mavis, find the Condor’s Nest as they had issues getting theirs mailed to them and need to pick it up at the campus. The Condor finds it and learns of what the Condor’s Nest does.</p><p>The story beats are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>After finishing the student engagement quest, The Condor can find Mavis and learns that she couldn’t get her ONECard in time for school, so she needs to go to the Condor’s Nest to retrieve it.</p></li><li><p>In the E Wing, the player finds the Condor’s Nest and can ask them about GRT passes, Condor Cash, Lockers, and of course, ONECards. There isn’t much information about what a ONECard does as the student should already know (aside from how Condor Cash works with it). This quest was added as some people need to know where they can get their ONECard if they’d made arrangements to pick it up at the college or where to ask about it.</p></li></ul><h2 id="DoonKeyMomentsforWaterloo-TheVARLab"><strong>The VARLab</strong></h2><p>In this quest, the Condor learns about the VARLab, an organization within Conestoga that develops simulations and other such cool things for the college, when they choose to pay them of course, which isn’t very often. There’s an issue with the simulations however, and the Condor must go inside the cyberspace and fix them from the inside.</p><p>The major story beats are as follows:</p><ul><li><p>The Condor finds an ambassador for the VARLab in The Pit, and gets a brief overview of what The VARLab does. They’re also told that the VARLab is doing a showcase for their simulations at Doon Campus today.</p></li><li><p>The Condor goes to the room the VARLab is using and learns a bit more about the VARLab. They agree to help the VARLab with their simulation problem.</p></li><li><p>Inside the cyberspace, the Condor learns about three of the VARLab’s simulations, Heavy Equipment, Trucking and Motive Power.</p></li><li><p>After fixing the sims, The Condor learns more about the VARLab and where they’re located in Waterloo.</p></li></ul><p />
