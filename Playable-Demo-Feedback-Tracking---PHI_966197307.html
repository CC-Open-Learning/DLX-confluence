 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Discussion about areas of the restaurant we have not yet explored:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bathrooms (Public and Staff)</strong> - Carolina asked if we can have single-user bathrooms that do not have multiple stalls, Ken agreed that is fine.  Each bathroom needs to have a toilet, a wastebasket, toilet tissue, and a compliant handwashing station (soap, water, paper towels or hand dryer).  Some non-compliances that we are already using in other areas of the restaurant could also be found in the bathrooms, such as improperly stored food, evidence of pests, no hand soap, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Staff Locker/Changeroom</strong> - It is fine for this area to have a single-user bathroom, same as the ones we will use for the public.  Same non-compliances as the public bathrooms, particularly with improper food storage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Waste Management</strong> - This one is tricky, because it happens outside of the restaurant, behind the facility.  We do not want our user to actually exit the facility, so we will just show them a back Exit door or Fire door (must be clearly marked as an exit).  The door itself will be the &ldquo;inspectable&rdquo; and will have the usual behaviours such as hover highlight.  This is the only door in the facility that will NOT open automatically when you approach it (in fact, it will not actually open at all).  When the student clicks on the door, they will get an inspection panel with an image of the waste management area.  </p><ul><li><p><strong>Compliant </strong>state will look like a dumpster or trash cans with lids securely closed, no loose or bagged garbage heaped around the dumpster or cans, no evidence of pests. Area should look neat and tidy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Non-Compliant </strong>state will look like no container (just a big heap of trash bags piled up) or an overflowing dumpster with the lid not closed. Garbage (in bags and/or loose garbage) will be spilled all around the containers/bags, there can be pests such as live rats, raccoons, or birds feasting on the exposed trash. It should look really gross.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Worker Attire</strong> - We may wish to consider adding another cutout NPC so that the student can inspect their attire in the food preparation area (back kitchen would be ideal).  In the spreadsheet, we have a non-compliance for a very dirty/disgusting apron that a worker is wearing while in the food preparation area.  This NPC could disappear after the student inspects their attire, although this might make it difficult for the student to change their inspection result if they misclick or want another look?  Something to think about.</p></li></ul></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>

Our Q&amp;A meeting was not an in-depth analysis of the student feedback, because they team had not had any opportunity to review or consolidate the feedback prior to meeting with Ken, but we did take the opportunity to raise several questions that came up during the students' experience, to get Ken&rsquo;s perspective.  I&rsquo;ll focus on capturing those responses here:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Results NOT Feedback: </strong> The most important decision that Ken made in our meeting was to agree that our original plan of evaluating the student&rsquo;s inspection results (&ldquo;marking&rdquo; inspection results as Correct, Incorrect, Invalid) is not actually going to work.  We decided that our Inspection Results will continue to include a<strong> complete record of all the inspections</strong> that the student recorded during their playthrough, but <strong>without any evaluation or feedback </strong>for those inspection results.  <br /><span data-colorid="ieqrunn7fw">Rationale: </span> There are many contextual or situational variables that impact inspection results, which are not possible to include in our virtual experience without adding an enormous amount of scope to the project.  For example, when the student inspector finds a rice bin sitting directly on the floor in the pantry, this could be a storage issue that needs to be recorded as a non-compliance, or it could just be  temporary situation while someone is using the rice to prepare a recipe.  If the temperature readings on the wall thermometer and the free-hanging thermometer in the walk-in cooler are showing very different temperatures, further investigation would be required to determine if one of the thermometers was faulty, or if they are both correct and the fault is with the refrigeration unit. Bottom line, there is just no way for us to judge the compliance or non-compliance of every inspectable, because there may be factors contributing to either outcome.  The student will provide those notes and details in their Hedgehog report, but there is no opportunity to do so in the DLX, so we can&rsquo;t judge.  Decision as follows: </p></li></ul><div class="table-wrap"><table data-table-width="760" data-layout="default" data-local-id="652d74e1-4bba-40c3-826a-4c83313adc33" class="confluenceTable"><tbody><tr><th data-highlight-colour="#abf5d1" class="confluenceTh"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DLX Inspection Results WILL include</strong></p></th><th data-highlight-colour="#ffbdad" class="confluenceTh"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Results WILL NOT include</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>Complete list of inspections recorded in the Inspection Log (all Compliant and Non-Compliant inspections) including photos and temperature readings, if taken.</p></li></ul></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>Any feedback about correct/incorrect/invalid inspection results.  </p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>List of Non-Compliances that were present in the scene, but were NOT reported by the student.</p></li></ul></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>Any indication that the student&rsquo;s assessment of those inspectables (if any) was &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo;.

For this reason, we will add some extra steps to the Introduction task so that the task will begin at the reception desk (as it does now) and end at the manager&rsquo;s office (will need to be added, does not exist yet).</p></li><li><p><a class="external-link" href="https://stuconestogacon.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/VARLab/EVKv2qEKhMdLqT34fWEZtzIBB4FEEBsz7XF_3FDS0ZqUuQ?e=Gz8Lim" rel="nofollow">PHI Script.xlsx</a> has been updated and reviewed by the CE as of 09APR2024</p></li></ul></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>

This is an online class, students will login from home.  Katrina and Sana will attend the class to facilitate the playable demo and gather feedback.</p></li><li><p>Ken demonstrated the Hedgehog software and we were easily able to see how students would take info from the DLX results, including photos, and use them in the Hedgehog report.  Ken clarified that not ALL public health units use this specific software, but all of the software programs are fairly similar.</p></li><li><p>We noticed that the report title in Hedgehog includes the restaurant name - so we might want to think about giving our virtual restaurant a name!  However, Ken also pointed out that Hegehog doesn&rsquo;t like it when there are numerous reports in progress for the same facility, so maybe that&rsquo;s a bad idea.  Let&rsquo;s discuss in future - not an urgent idea and it does sound fun!</p></li><li><p>The Hedgehog report has lots of details at the beginning for the inspector to answer regarding details such as:</p><ul><li><p>Type of servies offered at this restaurant (take-out, catering, etc)</p></li><li><p>Past history (linked to outbreak? past infractions?)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Katrina suggested that those details could be provided outside the DLX, so that they could be randomized or updated term by term or year by year. Ken loved this idea!  Even though it would be possible for us to include these details in the Welcome screen or other in-game resource, the details would then be locked in and Ken could not change them whenever he wants.  He prefers to keep them separate from the DLX.</p></li><li><p>Hedgehog report might be filled out DURING the inspection, or at some point AFTER the inspection, at the discretion of the inspector.  There is no &ldquo;correct way&rdquo; and every inspector has to do what works for them.</p></li><li><p>Inspectors may choose to keep notes in a physical notebook during the inspection, or they might choose to rely on the in-game Activity and Inspection Logs - again, this is at their discretion.</p></li><li><p>Question from Sana:  If we give the student feedback in the Results to tell them what they missed or inspections that they got wrong, won&rsquo;t that tempt them to change what they enter in their Hedgehog report (pretend that they did those things correctly)?  Ken explained that students could be required to submit their DLX Results (the whole results or a screen capture or whatever) as an attachment to their Hedgehog report, making it easy to spot discrepancies.  Ken isn&rsquo;t worried, because the main focus is on the Hedgehog report and identifying a pattern of behaviour and an understanding of what to do and how to respond in different situations.  Great discussion!</p></li><li><p>Ken understands that all of the follow-up actions that an inspector is required to report on in Hedgehog (e.g. food that has to be discarded, equipment that needs repair, storage problems that need to be corrected) will NOT happen in-game as part of this inspection.  In the DLX, the student inspector will identify the non-compliances and record them.  In Hedgehog, the student will need to demonstrate that they understand how they WOULD respond to each situation if it happened in real life.  It is not important for the student to practice those follow-up actions in this game, because that is not the focus of this learning experience.  Whew.</p></li></ul><h2 id="PlayableDemoFeedbackTracking-PHI-21MAR2024-CEfeedbackfrom:KenDiplock">21 MAR 2024 - CE feedback from: Ken Diplock</h2><p>Build <a class="external-link" href="https://stuconestogacon.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/VARLab/EUCDB1plvRRMsmN-YgZMLoAB6AimmAQ2BrqId0QMq3Qr2g?e=ZgvFQ4" rel="nofollow">PHI-24W5.3 - 14MAR2024.zip</a></p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-table-width="950" data-layout="default" data-local-id="03ef9006-7e43-47be-a9eb-040a118facbd" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 589.0px;" /><col style="width: 361.0px;" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><th data-highlight-colour="#b3d4ff" class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Stakeholder Feedback</strong></p></th><th data-highlight-colour="#b3d4ff" class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Jira Ticket Number(s)</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><ul><li><p>Students should be allowed to walk around anywhere in the dining area of the restaurant before they introduce themselves.

Is it okay to have food cooking (burger on the grill) and food in the buffet table in the dining room?</strong><br />A: Absolutely! It is not uncommon to do an inspection shortly before or shortly after a restaurant is serving customers. In this case, it is totally appropriate to have a burger cooking on the grill (be sure to lift the burger off the grill to inspect it, otherwise the temperature reading might not be accurate) and food in the buffet table in the dining room, even though there are no kitchen staff or customers visible in the scene. These inspections do not require interaction with people.</p></li><li><p><strong>Q: Can we get a chance to get feedback from any students this W24 term?</strong><br />A: Yes!  We can show students a demo build (not in class, just as a voluntary &ldquo;preview&rdquo; event) and get their feedback! We do not need VLT approval or a milestone release for this focus group, because the DLX will not be released for students. They will only access it at the playable demo.</p></li><li><p><strong>Q: Are there any inspections or features in the game that we should prioritize for Milestone 1?  What&rsquo;s the best time to release Milestone 1 to students in the program?</strong><br />A: Ken will go over the table of inspection non-compliances to make sure that we cover the ones that are really important for Milestone 1.  Students will be able to use the first milestone release in F24, so we should aim to have it ready by the end of August 2024.  There are no special requirements for the conference, we will just focus on what students and instructors need.</p></li></ul><h2 id="PlayableDemoFeedbackTracking-PHI-06MAR2024-CEfeedbackfrom:KenDiplock">06 MAR 2024 - CE feedback from: Ken Diplock</h2><p>Build <a class="external-link" href="https://stuconestogacon.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/VARLab/EXXMn71yZpNAos3fhxGVrU8BX0RPjuDNLk5iLsa48m6feg?e=evstti" rel="nofollow">PHI-24W5.0 - 06MAR2024.zip</a></p><p>Note that the CE contacted me to report that he <strong>could not launch the playable demo build PHI-24W4.3 - 29FEB2024.zip</strong> that was posted to the isolated course shell.
