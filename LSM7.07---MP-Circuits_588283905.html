During the course of the project, we have failed to generate any real engagement from the CE&rsquo;s for the Lab 10 module. We still don&rsquo;t have a good understanding of the key learning objectives for this lab, nor a lab procedure that we can try to adapt to the DLX learning environment.  We did develop some art assets, but we have not been successful in gathering requirements for the lab procedure.  At this time, I have proposed to VLT that we <strong>remove Lab 10 from scope</strong> and generally release Labs 1-9 using the Ohm&rsquo;s Law Circuit Trainer board.  Russ has approved this proposal.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="uos4qak50j"><del>NOTE: This change has not yet been discussed with the CE or other project stakeholders</del></span></strong><span data-colorid="en9dlx3vc5"><del>.

We have agreed that any missing functionality must be documented as a Bug in Jira, so that it can be included in the Release Notes.  These tickets will have low priority because they are not expected to interfere with any of the required workflows in any way, but we will watch student feedback carefully to ensure that none of these missing ports or components are causing problems.  If necessary, we can &lsquo;disable&rsquo; or otherwise block non-functional ports or components from being used, to prevent any chance that they would cause confusion or problems for students.  We will wait for further input from ID, CE, and student feedback to make a final decision.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><time datetime="2024-01-15" class="date-past">15 Jan 2024</time> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>SpiceSharp implementation is underway and progressing well.  </p></li><li><p>Still no input from CE or Chair about our proposal to have lab procedures and results outside of the DLX in a Lab Worksheet or similar type of document. We assume that this approach will be acceptable, and will offer the added benefit of being able to update the lab procedures over time without needing code changes (or minimal code changes) to the digital twin.</p></li><li><p>We have agreed to publish one SCORM package for each Lab 6-9, to provide a consistent user experience and allow instructors the option of showing/hiding each module as they see fit.

This sandbox module contains no user prompts, no feedback, no knowledge checks.  All of the procedural information to complete the lab, including space to record results or measurements, would be in the accompanying Lab Worksheet documents. We thought this meant that one module could be used for all labs without needing a separate SCORM package for each lab.  HOWEVER, Labs 8 and 9 are unique in that the student does not build the circuit!  The student is presented with an existing circuit that is not functioning as expected due to faulty components.  We are trying to figure out how to make this work - we cannot risk the student building a circuit that does not use the faulty components, because they would be unable to complete the troubleshooting learning objectives for Labs 8 and 9 if there are no faults to identify.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><time datetime="2023-12-18" class="date-past">18 Dec 2023</time> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>Dev proposal to use <a class="external-link" href="https://spicesharp.github.io/SpiceSharp/" rel="nofollow">SpiceSharp</a> package for digital twin functionality is very promising - this will solve quite a number of our procedural problems, and will mean that we can completely discontinue step-by-step guided lab procedures in the user interface.

The major blocker is that the behaviour of the trainer board is &ldquo;hard-coded&rdquo; and the shift from very specific step by step instructions in Labs 1-5 to the less-specific instructions in Labs 6 &amp; 7 is much more complicated than originally recognized.  We either need to implement much richer behaviour for the trainer board (ie. digital twin) or we need to go back to the specific procedural instructions that we were using in Labs 1-5.

Both will be tested in playthrough testing. Hard to say if other aspects of the UI will also need optional accessibility options, nothing else identified at this time.</p></li><li><p>Students no longer need to select what colour lead they want to use, it is automatically selected for them at every step.

CE&rsquo;s feel strongly that simplicity is more important than strict realism, so we will look for compromises that will optimize for ease of use and clear results.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><time datetime="2023-04-28" class="date-past">28 Apr 2023</time> </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>Initial design kickoff meeting with CE&rsquo;s Kevin Bell and Adam Jarosz</p></li><li><p><strong>Milestone 1</strong> has been agreed as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Labs 1 - 5 (or as far as we can get by the start of F23 term)</p></li><li><p>Labs will be completed using a virtual model of the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.consulab.com/products/all-products/cl-1919-05-053044-ohms-law-and-dc-circuits-trainer" rel="nofollow">Consulab Ohm&rsquo;s Law and DC Circuits Trainer </a></p></li><li><p>Each lab will be designed to stand alone, no dependencies between labs (could be built as a separate SCORM package, or we could later choose to combine the labs into a single SCORM modules with a menu, we can decide later)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Current focus is on designing the UI and envisioning learner workflows.</p></li><li><p><a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-account-id="60354a092de69b006a06c164" href="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki/people/60354a092de69b006a06c164?ref=confluence" target="_blank" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki">Stacey Dineen (Unlicensed)</a> to arrange with CE&rsquo;s to film demonstration of each lab, along with discussion about common mistakes and appropriate level of feedback/guidance in the student workflows</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="LSM7.07-MPCircuits-ObjectivesforMotivePower-Trucking&amp;Coach-ElectricalCircuits">Objectives for Motive Power - Trucking &amp; Coach - Electrical Circuits</h2><p>The objective of this module is to allow MP Trucking &amp; Coach students to practice their theoretical knowledge of automotive/commercial vehicle electrical circuits and power systems in a workbench-style virtual lab environment.  </p><p>The project charter describes 10 main tasks that the DLS should cover: </p><ol start="1"><li><p>Basic circuit - power source, conductors, load devices (pictorial/visual and schematic/technical form)</p></li><li><p>Add-on Basics - Circuit protection and control devices</p></li><li><p>Build a series circuit</p></li><li><p>Build a parallel circuit</p></li><li><p>Build a series-parallel circuit</p></li><li><p>Circuit faults - this could be a diagnostic type of lab where the student has to identify the cause and repair a fault in a specific type of circuit</p></li><li><p>Electrical test equipment - meters, test light, power probe(Trademark) if possible, AVR(battery tester)</p></li><li><p>Voltage drop testing step by step - need clarification on how this is different from #6, possibly combine</p></li><li><p>Testing circuit faults - need clarification on how this is different from #6, possibly combine.</p></li><li><p>Battery test foundation</p></li></ol><h2 id="LSM7.07-MPCircuits-Release1-FirstmilestonedeliverableDLXtargetis"><span data-colorid="xbnpyteqen">Release 1 - First milestone deliverable DLX target is </span><time datetime="2023-09-01" class="date-past">01 Sep 2023</time><span data-colorid="rerecxfp8i"> </span></h2><ul><li><p>The first release will include at least Labs 1-3 (possibly up to Lab 5, depending on progress and feedback)</p></li><li><p>See this page for details about the Release 1 Labs <a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/l/cp/j4eHWo1T" rel="nofollow">https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/l/cp/j4eHWo1T</a> </p></li></ul><h2 id="LSM7.07-MPCircuits-Successmetrics">Success metrics</h2><p /><div class="table-wrap"><table data-table-width="960" data-layout="wide" data-local-id="d2160f98-982c-4622-b8e3-1b639b753d55" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 451.0px;" /><col style="width: 242.0px;" /><col style="width: 267.0px;" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Goal</strong></p></th><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Metric</strong></p></th><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Notes</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Each of the 10 identified tasks will be a short stand-alone learning experience.
