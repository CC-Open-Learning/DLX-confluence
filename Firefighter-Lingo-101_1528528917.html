Like most specialities, firefighters have a lot of industry terminology that they use when they are communicating. These words and concepts are easily understood among fire service personnel, but can be confusing for IT or developers!  This is a living list of terms that you might hear in the Search and Rescue VR training room, to help you follow along and stay in the loop!</p><p>There are some great resources online where you can find any terminology that you&rsquo;re curious about, but don&rsquo;t find here.  A good example of such an online resource is here <a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://apxdata.com/firefighter-terms/" rel="nofollow">https://apxdata.com/firefighter-terms/</a> <br /></p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-table-width="760" data-layout="default" data-local-id="2c49bcca-bce1-4f75-bfda-0cd514a574bc" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 190.0px;" /><col style="width: 568.0px;" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Terminology</strong></p></th><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Meaning</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>1st floor</p><p>2nd floor</p><p>Basement</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Firefighters identify the levels of a multi-storey structure using these specific terms. </p><ul><li><p><strong>1st floor</strong> is the <strong>ground floor on the alpha side</strong> of the building.  </p></li><li><p><strong>2nd floor </strong>is upstairs from the 1st floor.  </p></li><li><p><strong>Basement </strong>is below grade on the alpha side of the building (maybe partly visible but has no entrance on alpha side). </p></li></ul><p>Firefighters never say &ldquo;bottom floor&rdquo; or &ldquo;main floor&rdquo; because this would add risk and cause confusion.</p><p>This can be particularly challenging when a structure is built into a slope, such as a house with a walk-out basement.  The levels of the house are identified from the alpha side, so the 1st floor is still the 1st floor when you enter it from charlie side (even though it is a lot further off the ground on that side of the building).  The basement is always the basement, even though it is at ground level on the charlie side.  Don&rsquo;t let this trick you - remember what the house looked like on the alpha side and go with that.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>360</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>A 360 is a quick, full visual assessment of the structure that is completed by walking around the entire structure and observing the building and the scene.  The assessment will include many factors including any visible smoke/fire, visible persons, points of entrance/egress, exposures such as trees, powerlines, hazardous materials, etc.  When everything looks normal on the 360, a firefighter would say there is &ldquo;nothing showing&rdquo;.</p><p>Pronounced &ldquo;three-sixty&rdquo;.  You would say that a particular firefighter or unit was &ldquo;on 360&rdquo; or &ldquo;on a 360&rdquo; to describe the act of making the visual assessment.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Alpha</p><p>Bravo</p><p>Charlie</p><p>Delta</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>These are exterior walls of the structure. Firefighters orient themselves and identify locations according to the exterior walls of the structure. </p><ul><li><p><strong>Alpha </strong>side of the structure is always the side that is <strong>facing the street</strong>, usually where the main entrance (front door) is located.  All other sides are identified in relation to the alpha side.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bravo </strong>is the side of the structure to your left, when you are facing the alpha side</p></li><li><p><strong>Charlie </strong>is the back/rear side of the structure, opposite the alpha side</p></li><li><p><strong>Delta </strong>is the side of the structure to the right, when you are facing the alpha side.</p></li><li><p>Corners are identified by the two sides that meet at that corner.  Alpha-Bravo is the front left corner, charlie-delta is the back right corner, etc.<br /><br />The exterior sides of the structure stay the same all the time, in relation to the alpha side. Firefighters refer to locations on the scene in relation to the structure, so you will hear them say &ldquo;<span data-colorid="dmzsercna1">Heavy smoke showing at bravo-charlie 2nd floor window</span>&rdquo; - they never say right or left, since those will change depending on where you are standing.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>CAN report</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>CAN report stands for Conditions, Actions, Needs.  This is a way of getting important status information about the structure and the crew, for the incident command that is outside of the structure.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Conditions </strong>would include smoke/visibility, heat, fire, etc.  </p></li><li><p><strong>Actions </strong>would be your current assignment and status of that task</p></li><li><p><strong>Needs </strong>would be an opportunity to request services/personnel to that location</p></li></ul><p>All up, this would sound like &ldquo;<span data-colorid="fgy0yval5i">Command, Pump 2, we&rsquo;re on the 2nd floor bravo charlie bedroom, heavy smoke, moderate heat, almost finished a right-hand search of the 2nd floor, need ventilation</span>&rdquo;</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Clear</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Standard communication protocol that helps radio communications to be successful.  Before conveying a message, firefighters will usually &ldquo;clear&rdquo; by making sure that the person(s) they are trying to communicate with are listening.  The format for this &ldquo;handshake&rdquo; is standardised, and always follows the format of HEY <strong>YOU</strong>, IT&rsquo;S <strong>ME</strong> - meaning that you always say who you are talking to before you tell them who is talking.  By following a standard format every time, it is easy for everyone to know who is talking to whom on a busy radio channel.</p><p>In class, this sounds like &ldquo;<span data-colorid="qeub5khwdi">Pump 1, this is Command</span>&rdquo; or &ldquo;IC, this is Aerial 3&rdquo;<br />The response is the same, only reversed, it sounds like &ldquo;<span data-colorid="wpop2n13sh">Command, Pump 1 go ahead</span>&rdquo;</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Command </p><p>or </p><p>I.C.</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Incident Command is a role that is responsible for the management of the entire scene.  Even when an officer is dispatched to the incident (e.g. Car 23 in the Dispatch example), they might not be the first to arrive, so another officer or firefighter might temporarily assume command of a scene until the dispatched officer arrives and then they would transfer command.  IC or Command is a role, not a person - whomever is currently serving in that role is referred to as IC or Command.  Assuming the role might sound like &ldquo;<span data-colorid="prefp52c5j">Dispatch, Car 23 is Incident Command at 1234 Winding Way</span>&rdquo;</p><p>Once Car 23 has assumed the role of Incident Command at 1234 Winding Way, everyone will address that person as &ldquo;Command&rdquo; or &ldquo;IC&rdquo; - they are no longer called Car 23 (until after they have transferred command to someone else or the incident is concluded).</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Dispatch</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Dispatch is the call that activates emergency services and tells them where to respond.  The dispatcher that initiates the call speaks directly to the fire crew via radio.  The call itself (or the act of initiating the call to service) is also called dispatch.</p><p>In radio comms, this person is referred to simply as &ldquo;Dispatch&rdquo; or sometimes &ldquo;Fire Dispatch&rdquo;.  A single dispatch can activate multiple different units  at once.  In class, Dispatch might sound like &ldquo;<span data-colorid="kau53hynt1">Conestoga Fire Pump 1, Pump 3, Aerial 6, Car 23 respond to 1234 Winding Way, Kitchener for reports of a structure fire</span>&rdquo;.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Downed Firefighter</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>This is the term for a firefighter that requires rescue.  The same term is used even when the firefighter is conscious - it does not literally mean &ldquo;down&rdquo; like unconscious.  More like in danger, distress, in need of assistance - not in service at this time.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>EMS</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Emergency Medical Services aka paramedics.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Exposure</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Exposures are other things/materials at the scene where the fire could spread, such as nearby buildings, trees, or other materials.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Halligan</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The halligan bar is a heavy iron tool that is carried by firefighters during search and rescue activities.  It can be used to sound the floor, as a pry bar to move furniture or doors, and as a sweeping tool to check for patients or obstructions that aren&rsquo;t visible in heavy smoke.</p><p>In the SAR 2.0 DLX, students must use their halligan to pry the door during the forcible entry task on the alpha side entrance.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>PAR</p><p>or </p><p>Calling a PAR</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>PAR is a <strong>Personnel Accountability Report</strong>.  This is a way of communicating location, assignment, and personnel status (number of persons, on/off air, lowest air pressure) so that Accountability/Command knows exactly where every firefighter is and that everyone is safe and on task.  This is different from a CAN report because the focus is on the personnel rather than the conditions.</p><p>Calling a PAR is the act of requesting units to provide the Personnel Accountability Report.  It might sound like &ldquo;All units, stand by for a PAR&rdquo; - this is a warning that lets all units know that they need to check in with their members and be ready to report.  </p><p>PAR might sound like &ldquo;<span data-colorid="yip1ezu4v4">Accountability, Pump 2 is par 4 (there are 4 firefighters present and accounted for), on air, conducting primary search of the1st floor, charlie side, lowest air is 4100.</span>&rdquo;  Other units would report in one by one in the same fashion until everyone is accounted for.  Then, Accountability would report to Incident Command to confirm &ldquo;<span data-colorid="mexaa9wxs0">Command, this is Accountability, we have PAR on all units</span>&rdquo;.  This final step confirms to IC that all firefighters are accounted for and safe.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Patient vs Victim</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Patient is the term for a civilian (not firefighter) in danger that needs to be rescued.  You might also hear the term victim, which is the same thing but seems to be older terminology.  One instructor explained it to me by saying that a patient is a person that you find and extricate from the structure, while a victim is the person you did not find <img class="emoticon emoticon-blue-star" data-emoji-id="1f61e" data-emoji-shortname=":disappointed:" data-emoji-fallback="😞" src="images/icons/emoticons/72/1f61e.png" width="16" height="16" data-emoticon-name="blue-star" alt="(blue star)"/>   Both terms can be heard in class and they mean the same thing.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>PPV</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Positive Pressure Ventilation - this is a really huge fan that can be strategically placed at the scene to push or pull a large volume air. Super noisy, often gas or diesel powered.  IC might assign students to do this imaginary task at the scene (they would go to the truck at the end of the driveway and pretend to set it up. It does not actually exist in the DLX)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Rehab</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Rehab is where firefighters go to recover and replenish their air cylinders during a structure fire.  At rehab, firefighters can rehydrate with water or gatorade, loosen/remove bunker gear as needed to cool off, replace any missing or compromised equipment, and get fresh air cylinders for their SCBA packs.  Rehab is always located outside the hot zone, at a truck that is designated and equipped for this purpose.  </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>RIT</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>RIT stands for Rapid Intervention Team. This is a designated crew that will serve as a stand-by rescue team for personnel and be available for the immediate search and rescue of any missing, trapped, injured or unaccounted for fire fighter(s).  These are the rescuers for the rescuers - in a mayday call, RIT is activated.</p><p>RIT is pronounced like it rhymes with &ldquo;bit&rdquo; (not spelled out like are-eye-tee)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>SCBA </p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>This is the <strong>Self Contained Breathing Apparatus</strong> worn by firefighters.  It consists of many parts, including the &ldquo;pack&rdquo; or harness, the regulator, the valve, the air cylinder(s), and the face mask.</p><p>Also sometimes called MSA (brand name of a popular manufacturer).</p><p>Pronounced by spelling it out, ess-see-bee-ay</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Stage/Staging</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Staging means preparing.  A staging area is a dedicated space where a very specific activity is set up, such as EMS staging.  In the SAR 2.0 incident scenes, there are EMS staging areas at the alpha and charlie sides of the structure (mats on the ground - you can imagine that there are EMS personnel and medical supplies prepped and ready for whatever casualties might need EMS).  </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>VEIS</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Ventilate Enter Isolate Search is a search and rescue tactic that you might hear about in class, even though it is not currently possible to execute this task in SAR 2.0.  To perform this type of search, a ladder or aerial would be used to gain access to a window. The firefighter would ventilate (break the window if safe to do so), enter the room through the window, isolate the room by searching outside the door and then closing the door, and search the room for patients.</p><p>Pronounced like &ldquo;vice&rdquo;.  Usually done when a room is in immediate danger, is difficult to get to from the inside, or is believed to contain patients in distress.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
