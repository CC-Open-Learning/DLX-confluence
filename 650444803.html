                    <p>As SAR 1.0 continues to be used in class, and with ongoing beta testing of SAR 2.0, lots of suggestions and requests are received.  There is no central place for us to record these “wishlist” items, so I’m creating this page to help us track feature/change requests for Search and Rescue.</p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>Note: These are NOT software “bugs”.  We normally address bugs directly with XPertVR via email.  This page will track requests that could reasonably be classified as new features, extensions, upgrades, or new workflows that are not intended to function in this way in the current project requirements.</p></div></div><p>Items that HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED in a milestone release of SAR 2.0 show a <img class="emoticon emoticon-tick" data-emoji-id="atlassian-check_mark" data-emoji-shortname=":check_mark:" data-emoji-fallback=":check_mark:" src="images/icons/emoticons/check.png" width="16" height="16" data-emoticon-name="tick" alt="(tick)"/> to indicate that these requests have been satisfied (maybe not perfect, but at least an initial implementation is there).</p><ol start="1"><li><p><img class="emoticon emoticon-tick" data-emoji-id="atlassian-check_mark" data-emoji-shortname=":check_mark:" data-emoji-fallback=":check_mark:" src="images/icons/emoticons/check.png" width="16" height="16" data-emoticon-name="tick" alt="(tick)"/> Feb 16 2023 <strong>Occupancy clues</strong>: Specific props should <u>conditionally</u> be present in scenarios to act as clues to the number/presence/age of victims placed in the scene.  These may include examples such as:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>No victims - no car in driveway, lights off </p></li><li><p>Adult victim(s) - car in driveway, lights on, shoes or jacket by entry </p></li><li><p>Child victim(s) - bike on lawn, toys or sports equipment on porch, toys on the main floor </p></li><li><p>Infant victim(s) - stroller on porch, toys, highchair, baby swing or playpen on main floor</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Feb 16 2023 <strong>Baby crib or playpen search mechanics</strong>:  The baby crib and (if present) playpen should include the option of being tipped forward away from the wall so that the firefighter can search for an infant in the crib from a position low to the floor. The student is not required to always tip the crib over to search it, but this option must be available for situations of heavy smoke and high heat where it would be dangerous to stand beside the crib to search inside.  The student would need to be able to reach up and grab the top rail of the baby crib and tip it toward themselves, with the front legs acting like a pivot point.  Anything in the crib (blankets, toys, infant) would roll onto the railing as it is lowered to the floor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Controller rumble to signal when hand is in contact with the wall</strong>. This is important tactile feedback that students are taught to use in low visibility rooms to make sure they stay on the wall as they search for victims.  In multi-player, the hand would need to rumble when you contact your partner firefighter (if you are not the firefighter closest to the wall.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smoke/visibility based on the location of the fire. </strong>The smoke in the SAR 1.0 sim is great, but it never changes and this is substantially misleading to the student.  In real life, the smoke starts bad and then <u>gets significantly worse</u> as soon as there is water on the fire.  What this means is that, if a student enters the house and they can faintly make out a few doorways, a set of stairs, etc - if they roughly get a sense of the layout, that is their ONLY CHANCE to take note of those things.  Within minutes, the smoke will be so heavy that they can't see anything above the level of their shins.  This is not at all represented in the 1.0 version, and gives the student the idea that they can just go back and look around later, or find things as they go.</p><ul><li><p>When the fire is on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor, the smoke at the entryway is appropriate. It should get at least 3X heavier after the first 2-3 minutes in the sim, and continue to get worse the longer you are in the house.</p></li><li><p>When the fire is on the 1<sup>st</sup> floor, the smoke at the entryway is way too light. It should ROLL out the door on forcible entry and be like a solid wall.  You should not be able to see anything that is more than 10-20cm from your face, and nothing at all above knee level.</p></li><li><p>Rooms (especially the garage, because that is usually an exterior door) that have the door closed should have almost no smoke when you first open the door. Every 10 seconds that the door is open, the smoke should get heavier and heavier until it is equal to the area outside the door.  </p></li></ul><p>This isn't just about making the sim feel realistic and cool.  This is a critical part of the learning path for the student, who needs to understand the urgency of looking around an area while it is visible.  Something important (like an unconscious child in a crib) will only be visible for the first 5-10 seconds. If the student enters the nursery and doesn't look straight at the crib (e.g. they go to the closet instead) they could miss their only opportunity to rescue that baby.  This is the reality of the job.</p></li><li><p><strong>Communications - different levels for different semesters</strong>.<strong> </strong> The UI for comms is so difficult and complicated in SAR 1.0 that the student has to stop everything they are doing in order to communicate, which nobody wants to do. In SAR 2.0, the UI is simple, but there’s no guidance or “entry level” - the student is supposed to already know what to say. Instructors provided some great suggestions below to add teaching value:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Level 1 - Just listen</strong>:  Comms can be automatic, just built into specific events in the game. The student will benefit from hearing the communications between &quot;themselves&quot; and command, without having to do anything to make that happen.  Examples: Every time the student enters or exits the house, moves from one floor to another, or encounters a victim, there should be automatic communications.  Periodically through the sim, command should call a PAR or request a CAN report and the student can just listen.  This option is great for semester 2 students, who will passively learn the correct format for their communications just by listening. They will also learn to “scan” for important information in radio traffic while staying focused on their current task.</p></li><li><p><strong>Level 2 - Simple participation</strong>: Comms pop up in front of the student when they are contacted by the IC. &quot;Pump 4 this is Command&quot; - see a simple menu (not multi-level 30 responses available, just 3 choices) and maybe navigate with thumbstick.  The interface has to be so quick and simple that the student isn't significantly interrupted in their current task. In real life, they communicate WHILE they are conducting the search, not instead of conducting the search.  Comms could be included in the email result so they can review with their instructor and identify any weaknesses. This option is great for late semester 2 or early semester 3, where students should know what to communicate, but might still be searching for the right words or learning the right level of detail.</p></li><li><p><strong>Level 3 - No help</strong>, just live voice comms with IC and fellow players.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="36f673b4-5c17-47df-9a14-bb0b856d63eb">Start the simulation in the truck</span></strong><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="36f673b4-5c17-47df-9a14-bb0b856d63eb">, so students can hear the dispatch &amp; response, and experience arriving on the scene.  Students need to be trained to “size up” the incident to communicate with IC (who may not be in position yet or might not have a good view). This will help them scan for important details and communicate them back to IC.  </span></p></li><li><p><img class="emoticon emoticon-tick" data-emoji-id="atlassian-check_mark" data-emoji-shortname=":check_mark:" data-emoji-fallback=":check_mark:" src="images/icons/emoticons/check.png" width="16" height="16" data-emoticon-name="tick" alt="(tick)"/>  <strong>Students should have to manually go “on air”</strong> when they enter the hot zone, and they should practice communicating that event with Accountability.  In SAR 1.0 (and early build of 2.0) the student is “on air” the moment they load into the scene, even though they are outside and might need to conduct a 360 sizeup of the house before entering the hot zone.  Using up all their air before they even enter the building means that they only get a short time to search before they have to exit the structure. It also occasionally happens that students who are excited about entering the live fire tower might forget to go on air, and need to be reminded to do so before entering the structure.  Having them practice this crucial step in the SAR sim would be a good way to reduce errors.</p></li><li><p><img class="emoticon emoticon-tick" data-emoji-id="atlassian-check_mark" data-emoji-shortname=":check_mark:" data-emoji-fallback=":check_mark:" src="images/icons/emoticons/check.png" width="16" height="16" data-emoticon-name="tick" alt="(tick)"/>  <strong>Need “rehab” option where students can reset their SCBA to full air </strong>so that they can continue searching even if they have run out of air. In the current simulation, a firefighter that is low on air has to exit the scenario even if they have not completed their assignment or found any of the victims, just doesn’t make sense. This doesn’t need to be technical - it could just be a box that we grab similar to the “End Scenario” box, but make it a different colour and call it “Rehab” - just magically resets your SCBA to full.</p></li><li><p><img class="emoticon emoticon-tick" data-emoji-id="atlassian-check_mark" data-emoji-shortname=":check_mark:" data-emoji-fallback=":check_mark:" src="images/icons/emoticons/check.png" width="16" height="16" data-emoticon-name="tick" alt="(tick)"/>  <strong>Need in-game feedback if students enter the hot zone without going on-air</strong> Now that students can manually go on and off air (see Item 7 this page), it inevitably happens that students forget to turn their air on before entering the structure.  This should result in very serious in-game consequences, as this would be impossible not to notice in real life, and would be fatal in just a few seconds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Alpha door needs to open if the student touches it anywhere</strong> - there is no need to touch the doorknob on a door that has already been forced with a halligan bar.</p></li><li><p><strong>Expand the “hot zone” where the player is required to be on-air. </strong> Currently, students do not have to go on air until they are actually inside the structure, but this does not line up with their training.  Toxic gases and superheated air are not confined by residential walls, particularly when the firefighter or the fire itself has breached the exterior (e.g. door is cracked or window blown out).  Students should get a warning about being on air as soon as they are within 1m of any entry point, or within 4m of a working fire. You would never open or force a door without SCBA if you knew the structure was involved.</p></li><li><p><strong>Need extrication options for rescuing patients.</strong> Currently, the student can only grab and drag a patient when they find them in the structure.  In real life, firefighters need to choose the best/safest extrication method for every patient, based on factors such as patient condition (loc, injuries, size and abilites, etc) and fire conditions (immediate risks, closest point of egress, space available, etc) and resources (number of crew mates, tools such as webbing/rope, etc). Firefighters are trained in <strong>numerous patient removal drags and carries</strong>, and a whole other set options for a downed firefighter (using the MSA pack).  I don’t know how reasonable it is to try to represent every different option, but we should seriously consider adding at least a few different situations where a firefighter needs to choose a drag/carry that is appropriate for the scenario.  2 and 3-person carries would be an excellent opportunity to practice communication and teamwork under duress.  At the very least, we should include some carry options for unresponsive victims found on the 2nd floor - we would never drag someone down the stairs if we had another option. The goal is to keep them safe, not break their bones.</p></li><li><p><strong>Need more intelligent sound effects in-game</strong>.  Currently, players are able to identify that a working fire is present on their 360 scene sizeup, even when no smoke or fire are showing on the building exterior.  This is because the crackling fire sound effects are playing even while the player is outside on the driveway.  Players should not have superhero hearing powers in the game - they should get visual and auditory clues about the scene only when they would realistically be able to see or hear them in real life.</p></li><li><p><strong>Player names are printed in white on a white background</strong>, causing them to be mostly unreadable. Pick any other colour for the firefighter names, or move them away from the big white MSA label on the packs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Forcible Entry on the Alpha door should be configurable. </strong> We need a toggle for Alpha Door Locked on the first page of the Command configuration UI, so that forcible entry doesn’t need to be part of EVERY evolution.  By the time we’ve played through 15 or 20 times, this really doesn’t have any learning value anymore.  Plus, students are being trained to ALWAYS force the alpha door in our game, when their training specifically tells them to “Try before you pry” - meaning that they should never put irons to a door that might be unlocked and all they have to do is try it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tutorial needs to be navigable by topic.</strong>  Brand new VR users in this program are strictly limited to 10 minutes in the headset to prevent symptoms of nausea, headache, and dizziness that frequently occur for inexperienced players.  We have had excellent results by limiting exposure and having players take short turns while they are acclimating to the VR experience, but this makes the tutorial really irritating because there is no way to skip through the parts you’ve already done.  Also, if a player needs a quick refresher on just one aspect of the game, they have to play the whole damn tutorial from the beginning just to get the one thing they needed.  Provide a menu and let them select which part of the tutorial they want to do. At the end of each segment, dump them back to the menu.</p></li></ol><h2 id="TrackingSAR&quot;Wishlist&quot;Requests-MajorNewFunctionalityforSAR3.0orBeyond">Major New Functionality for SAR 3.0 or Beyond</h2><p>The following wishlist items are beyond the scope of the 2.0 project and should probably only be considered in the context of a major new release.</p><ol start="1"><li><p><strong>Need to update the game platform to retire the Cosmos VIVE headsets.</strong>  Every month that we use the VIVE hardware in the VARDeck, we have more and more difficulty with the aging headsets.  The cords are a serious impediment to free movement and they add risk for everyone (including students &amp; instructors that are not in the headset).  Frequent loss of tracking between the visors and controllers mean that players will lose (or lose use of) their hands in-game, causing them to be unable to participate in that evolution.  Headsets need to be restart frequently and may lose tracking or calibration data while the player is in-game.  These incidents have a very high impact on learner engagement and may affect students of taller stature to an unfair degree when compared with their peers of average height.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fire Suppression/Hoseline Workflows</strong>.  No firefighter would ever enter an involved structure, certainly not the immediate area of a working fire, without a hoseline on the fire.  For the purposes of our Search and Rescue-focused simulation, maybe we don’t need a player to personally DO the fire attack, so much as we need to REPRESENT these tasks in-game. There are a number of key tasks that a student could be assigned, and simply click-to-complete in game:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>WATER SUPPLY: We need a fire hydrant in the game for establishing water supply (one of the first and most urgent tasks when you roll up at a  structure fire).  At the hydrant, the student could just touch the hydrant with a tool to watch an unmanned or AI-staffed animation of the hydrant being tapped and initial supply line established. The student would be responsible for communicating with IC in this task and confirming when it is complete.</p></li><li><p>FIRE ATTACK: Student can initiate fire attack based on selecting a location.  For example, if the student chose to attack a fire in the 1st floor alpha bravo corner of the building from the front lawn, we could play an animation of a transitional fire attack where the correct angle and nozzle stream are demonstrated.  The student would be responsible for communicating with IC in this task and confirming when it is complete.  In time, this could be enhanced until the student is controlling the nozzle and the angle of the stream, but there would be good procedural learning just by watching the animation and communicating about this task with IC.</p></li><li><p>FOLLOW THE HOSELINE: Students are trained from day one that the hoseline is their connection to the outside world, it will always lead them to the truck.  They are taught to follow the hoseline to get out of the structure, to stay together as a team, and to clearly understand exactly where a previous crew left off when searching.  Crews that are extricating victims up or down stairs need to learn to expect to work around hoselines on the stairs, and crews have to “bump” the hose up to allow the nozzle to advance through the structure.  Just having a hoseline in the structure would be a huge benefit to teaching students how to self-rescue in a bad situation where they have been separated from their pump and need to evacuate.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Ventilation Workflows</strong>:  Students need to be able to ventilate work areas (or call for ventilation) to improve the survivability of the structure interior and make it easier to see victims.  </p><ol start="1"><li><p>Window ventilation can be done from the exterior (possibly using a ladder, for anything unreachable from ground level) or interior, by smashing the window with an iron.  The player would only need to touch their halligan bar to a window to vent (or watch an animation of an AI player doing that action)  When ventilated, the smoke in the immediate area (few m) should move and clear, visibility should improve (also heat, but we don’t have any heat in game).</p></li><li><p>Positive Pressure Ventilation:  This is a large powerful fan that is stored on the truck. The student could go to the truck and get it, and then place it where it can facilitate ventilation.</p></li></ol></li></ol>
