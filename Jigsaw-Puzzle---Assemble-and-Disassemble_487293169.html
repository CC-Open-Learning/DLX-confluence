                    <p><style>[data-colorid=jd3hrc548u]{color:#0747a6} html[data-color-mode=dark] [data-colorid=jd3hrc548u]{color:#5999f8}[data-colorid=x0ijwm8n23]{color:#0747a6} html[data-color-mode=dark] [data-colorid=x0ijwm8n23]{color:#5999f8}</style>The concept here is simple:  </p><p>Similar to a jigsaw puzzle game, the learner would need to put the correct pieces into their correct position. Ideally, this would also include a procedural aspect, where there is also a specific order for how the pieces need to be placed (ie. correct order of pieces, cannot place piece #4 until pieces 2 and 3 are in place)</p><p>&lt;insert sketch to illustrate concept&gt;</p><p /><p /><h2 id="JigsawPuzzle-AssembleandDisassemble-Feedback">Feedback</h2><p>Real-time feedback helps guide the learner to discovery of the correct path.  Feedback should be immediate, clear, and should not rely exclusively on one of the learner&rsquo;s 5 senses to be understood.  For example, if using a sound effect (ding for correct, sad trombone for incorrect), that feedback should be accompanied by a visual effect such as a thumbs-up/thumbs-down or checkmark and X.  Never rely exclusively on colour (green for correct/ red for incorrect) because differently-abled learners may not perceive colours as we do.</p><p>One idea: If the student tries to drag a piece to the &lsquo;puzzle&rsquo; and it is correct, it can snap into place with a visual and audio effect to signal success.  If the piece is dropped at the incorrect location OR at the incorrect time, the piece can return to the spot where it was picked up, along with a visual and audio effect to signal &ldquo;try again&rdquo;</p><h2 id="JigsawPuzzle-AssembleandDisassemble-ExampleUseCases">Example Use Cases</h2><p><strong><span data-colorid="jd3hrc548u">Personal Protective Equipment</span></strong>:  This is a more advanced version of the activity proposed in Drag &amp; Drop - Sort and Match, except this situation would be procedural as well.  The PPE would need to be applied in a specific order, perhaps in combination with steps like handwashing or other preparation steps.</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="x0ijwm8n23">Disassemble and/or Reassemble Equipment: </span></strong>Using a silhouette of the machine or equipment as a backdrop, the student could be prompted to click and remove one piece (component) at a time, in a specific order. The components could be placed on a workbench or in a bin or dishwasher.  The student would have to reassemble the machine or equipment to prepare for normal use. Voiceover could help enforce best practices or safety hazards as the learner is working.</p><h2 id="JigsawPuzzle-AssembleandDisassemble-ImplementationDesigninCOREv1">Implementation Design in COREv1</h2><p />
