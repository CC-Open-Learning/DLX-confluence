This document describes only the order of events for Guided Mode, because the learner will control their own progression through the inspection in Advanced Mode.  This order of events does not apply to Advanced Mode.  Various descriptions of the user experience for Advanced Mode are provided on this page - it is only the ORDER of events that can be disregarded for Advanced Mode.</p><p>Unlike Releases I-III, the Alternate Trailers module will NOT include previous inspection steps, nor will it use the International LT625 model or cargo van trailer model that were used for all previous releases.</p><p><strong>Release IV will stand alone, ONLY covering the ADDITIONAL inspections that would be required for each of the alternate trailers.</strong>  There are dozens of different types of trucks out there, and each one has its own  unique attributes or equipment for a student to learn.  The main objective of Release IV is not to repeat previous inspections steps with new equipment, but instead to focus specifically on the EXTRA steps that would be required if the pre-trip inspection was being done with a different trailer.  For that reason, we will not inspect any component on the alternate trailer that has already been covered in Release I-III.</p><p>Release I included the inspection of the cargo van trailer in great detail, including the van doors, latches, hinges, exterior lights, body condition, wheels and tires, and fifth wheel coupling.</p><p>Release II expanded on the cargo van trailer inspection by adding in inspection for dolly legs and cargo area (with van door animation).</p><p>Release III completed the pre-trip inspection requirements for the cargo van trailer by adding inspections for the air and power connections from the tractor, as well as the air brakes (chambers, lines) and trailer suspension (airbags, shocks).</p><p>Order of Inspection steps for Guided Mode in Release IV of the Trucking Pre-Trip Inspection simulation is inspired from inspection processes that we have found recorded on YouTube, as well as consultations with our content expert, John Way.</p><p>YouTube reference videos: <a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://youtu.be/NaQw-6s29AI" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/NaQw-6s29AI</a> and <a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://youtu.be/f3paadXFfaM" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/f3paadXFfaM</a> </p><h2 id="ReleaseIV-AlternateTrailers-GuidedModeUserExperience-InitialViewandWelcome"><span data-colorid="kjn50vwaqm">Initial View and Welcome</span></h2><p>On initial load, the camera will approach the front driver&rsquo;s side of the refrigerated trailer as though the student is walking towards it from a distance of approx 20-40m. This is from the student's point of view, at approx eye level, lasting no more than a few seconds to help orient the learner to the simulation environment. </p><p>The voiceover will welcome the student and advise them to follow the prompts to practice a walk-around inspection of the reefer trailer.  Students will be prompted to observe each inspectable item in order. </p><h2 id="ReleaseIV-AlternateTrailers-GuidedModeUserExperience-CameraBehaviourandNavigation"><span data-colorid="rjtdjhjicn">Camera Behaviour and Navigation</span></h2><p>In Guided Mode, the camera will move automatically for each inspection, there will be no need for the learner to navigate manually using either keyboard or mouse.  The Guided Mode inspection walks the student through the inspection process so that the student does not decide what to inspect or in what order.  For certain views, we will consider the optional use of camera pan and zoom, but the objective will always be to ensure that the learner can see whatever they need to inspect without fiddling around with the camera.</p><p>In Advanced Mode, the learner will have much more freedom in terms of camera movement.  We will consider the option of providing a Views menu, to allow the learner to quickly navigate to a specific area of the trailer, or we could allow free movement via Move controls or arrow/WASD keyboard navigation around the trailer.  The Physical Inspections tray will show up whenever a learner enters a designated POI area, and it will update or disappear when the learner exits that area.  While a learner is in a POI area (e.g. control panel) they can use the Next Inspection button on the toolbar to conveniently cycle through all of the inspection tasks at this  POI (e.g. temperature check, cooling mode selection, etc) until they have completed all of the available tasks at that POI. At that point, the student will click Next Inspection to be returned to the default camera location for this POI, where they can select a new POI.</p><h2 id="ReleaseIV-AlternateTrailers-GuidedModeUserExperience-InteractionModel"><span data-colorid="hrq2zutlwr">Interaction Model</span></h2><p>There are two types of inspections in this simulation: Visual and Physical.  </p><p><strong>Visual inspections</strong> are passive - they require no special view or extra action to identify the condition of the component being inspected.  Examples of visual inspections would include Fuel Gauge or Fluid Leaks.</p><p><strong>Physical inspections</strong> are active - these inspections require a specialized view (not the default view for the position where they occur) and may also require a simulated action.  Examples of physical inspections would include Motor Oil Check or Fuel Level Confirmation. To trigger a physical inspection, the learner will be prompted to click on the icon in the Physical Inspection menu.  Some physical inspections are also tactile inspections, where the student is prompted to FEEL something, such as the temperature of the air blowing from the defroster or the pressure of the brake pedal when they press it with their foot. Tactile inspections are signalled by the use of a hand or foot avatar on screen, and on-screen messages will explain to the student what they are &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; with descriptive text, e.g. &ldquo;The air is blowing, but it feels cold.&rdquo; or &ldquo;The brake pedal feels firm when pressed down with your foot&rdquo;.</p><p>Note: At each position of the inspection process, only the applicable icons will be available in the physical inspection tray.  These icons will change as the learner progresses to each stage of the inspection, so that the icon tray doesn&rsquo;t get too crowded or overwhelming.</p><p>For all inspection interactions, the learner will observe the virtual trailer model to evaluate the condition of the component, and will have two options for how to respond:  Report Damage or Continue.</p><p><strong>Report Damage:</strong> If the learner sees something wrong (or questionable), they will click on the item.  Clicking on the model will trigger the Inspection panel dialog box, which will provide selectable options for what types of damage/wear could occur for this component.  These options are customized for each component, so that only applicable options are displayed for the specific component (ie. fuel gauge will offer options such as low or critically low, while the thermostat will offer options such as low temperature or high temperature).  In Guided Mode, the learner will have timely feedback so that they can quickly correct or learn from their mistakes.  Note that the Inspection UI is ONLY used for reporting damage/wear.  There is no option in the dialog to report that a component is in good condition.</p><p><strong>Next Inspection (Nothing to Report):</strong> If the learner does not see anything wrong with the component under inspection, they will click the &ldquo;Next Inspection&rdquo; button in the toolbar to move on to the next component. This will prevent the learner from having to report components that are in good condition, which will make the inspection process true to real-life practice where only damage/wear is reported. In Guided Mode, the student will not be allowed to move on while there is unreported damage/wear.  If they fail to report damage that is present, the voiceover will prompt them to take a closer look, and will remind them about what to look for.  If the learner has successfully identified all damage/wear for a particular inspectable component, the Next Inspection button will move them to the next inspectable component at this position.  When all components at a particular position have been inspected successfully, the Next Inspection button will move the learner to the next position.</p><h2 id="ReleaseIV-AlternateTrailers-GuidedModeUserExperience-ProgressandFeedback"><span data-colorid="k922kf8oky">Progress and Feedback</span></h2><p>In Guided Mode, there is immediate feedback about answers being correct or incorrect, and the student is unable to proceed to the next step without completing all required tasks at each POI. For this reason, the Progress Checklist and Results Panel are not particularly useful in Guided Mode.</p><p>In Advanced Mode, the Progress Checklist and Results Panel will both be used to provide guidance and feedback to the student, as follows:</p><p><strong>Progress Checklist</strong> - The primary function of the Progress Checklist is to help the student identify what they have already completed in their inspection workflow, and what is left to be done.  Inspections will be grouped together into logical categories, which can be expanded to show more detailed information.  For example, at the highest level, the checklist can appear as a single page, with only top-level inspection tasks shown, such as Wheels, Mirrors, Windows, etc.  If a category is marked as complete, it means that all of the subtasks under that category are complete.  We can also show partially completed and &ldquo;to do&rdquo; status for categories, so that I student can quickly see if they have completed all of the necessary inspection workflow steps before submitting their inspection.  It is important to keep in mind that students can perform the inspection tasks in any order when in Advanced Mode, so it will be much easier for them to skip a step or forget to inspect something.  The checklist will help them keep track. The Progress Checklist is available in the bottom left toolbar at all times, the user can view it whenever they want.  The checklist cannot be used to navigate or to change inspection answers - it is a read-only progress indicator.   The Progress Checklist does not indicate if answers are correct or incorrect, and does not need to provide any details about what damages have been reported.  The student is free to revisit any part of the inspection at any time, so they can review/change their answers by simply revisiting a POI.</p><p><strong>Results Panel</strong> - Advanced Mode does not provide any immediate feedback to the learner about their selected answer for any of the inspection tasks.  Instead, feedback comes at the very end of the Advanced Mode user experience, when the student finalizes their inspection report and &ldquo;submits&rdquo; the inspection for evaluation.  At this point, the student will be shown a complete list of every inspection task (these may be organized in a familiar way that is consistent with the Progress Checklist, to help the student find what they are looking for) where each task will be given one of THREE results:</p><ul><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="gyis4i4qji">Green checkmark</span></strong> - This task was completed successfully. The selected answer is the correct answer.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="byamo0isr1">Red X</span></strong><span data-colorid="h8oh3cnw1a"> </span>- This task was completed, but the answer selected was incorrect. The correct answer will be provided at this time.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="rikimkp6zh">Incomplete</span></strong> - This result will be assigned to any inspection POI that was NOT VISITED by the student.  This is an important distinction because we want the student to get a different result when they missed/forgot a step in the inspection, even if there was no damage present at that POI in this case.</p></li></ul><p /><h2 id="ReleaseIV-AlternateTrailers-GuidedModeUserExperience-NewMenu-StudentmayselectRefrigeratedorFlatbedTrailer">New Menu - Student may select Refrigerated or Flatbed Trailer</h2><p>If the student selects Flatbed Trailer, they will go to Position #1 of the Flatbed Trailer segment</p><p>If the student selects Refrigerated Trailer, they will go to Postion #1 of the Reefer Trailer segment.</p><p>There is no limit to the number of times the student can inspect each trailer, and no specific order that they need to be inspected in.</p><h2 id="ReleaseIV-AlternateTrailers-GuidedModeUserExperience-Position#1-ReeferTrailerEngineCompartment(RTEng)">Position #1 - Reefer Trailer Engine Compartment (RTEng)</h2><p>The camera will stop at the front driver's side corner of the reefer trailer (note that the trailer may or may not be attached to the tractor, but it is necessary for the operator to be able to climb up and inspect the refrigeration unit. If the trailer is not attached to the truck, you will need a small ladder). The camera will go directly to the trailer, angled so that the view is looking at the refrigeration unit on the front of the trailer, from the vantage point of standing on the rear deck of the truck.&nbsp; This will be called Position RTEng. From here, the student will be reminded by the voiceover of routine inspections that would have already been covered in this immediate area.  Remember that the student will NOT repeat inspection tasks that they already performed on the cargo trailer. The voiceover will remind the student that all of those components have already been inspected, prior to prompting the student to start the additional inspection steps that are required for a refrigerated trailer.  </p><ol><li><p>Exterior Condition of the reefer unit (damage, abrasions to panels or access doors) - exterior of reefer unit</p></li><li><p>Open engine compartment doors and assess overall condition of reefer unit engine compartment (obvious fluid leaks, debris left in compartment such as glove or flashlight) - PHYSICAL INSPECTION button to open doors</p></li><li><p>Look for electrical faults (smoke, sparks)</p></li><li><p>Check refrigerant reservoir (low, damaged)</p></li><li><p>Check engine oil for reefer motor (low, leaking) using the dipstick - PHYSICAL INSPECTION</p></li><li><p>Engine belt (loose, damaged) - VISUAL INSPECTION ONLY there is no need to reach in and grab it. Note that some models have multiple belts for motor, fan, etc. while others have only one belt. We will only need ONE belt for our model, but the prompt and voiceover will indicate &ldquo;all belts&rdquo; to acknowledge that there could be more than one.</p></li><li><p>Close upper and lower engine compartment doors securely.  This can be in good state all the time, the student will simply be prompted to ensure the doors are secured.</p></li><li><p>Camera will follow as student descends to the ground from the rear deck of the tractor, voiceover reminds the student to look for any traffic and to maintain 3 points of contact at all times.</p></li></ol><p>After completing all of the tasks at the RTEng position, the learner will click on Continue to move to the next inspection point.&nbsp; In Guided Mode, if the learner tries to move on without identifying a damaged component, they will be unable to leave and will be prompted to complete what has been left undone.&nbsp; If all inspection tasks have been completed, they will move to the next inspection point.</p><h2 id="ReleaseIV-AlternateTrailers-GuidedModeUserExperience-Position#2-ReeferTrailerControlPanel(RTCon1)">Position #2 - Reefer Trailer Control Panel (RTCon1)</h2><p>The camera will move to focus on the reefer trailer control panel.&nbsp; This will be called Position RTCon1. From here, the student will be prompted to inspect the control panel for the refrigerated trailer.  </p><ol><li><p>Control panel display shows the current temperature and set temperature. No readings need to be inspected as good/bad at this time, but the voiceover will prompt the student to make note of the  temperatures when the display is initialized.  For example, this value might be 64F or 17C.  The set temperature is not really important right now, as long as it is substantially lower than the current temperature, for example it could be 38F or 4C.  It is common for the current temperature display to flash when the current temp is not equal to the set temp - I believe this is an indication that the refrigeration unit is working to reach the set temperature.</p></li><li><p>Activate the control panel pre-trip check by pressing the Menu or Options button, and selecting &ldquo;Pre-Trip&rdquo; from the menu. (always works).  This is not an inspection, it is a necessary step to continue the inspection.</p></li><li><p>Display panel shows some kind of &ldquo;In Progress&rdquo; indicator to show that it is busy running the pre-trip diagnostic routine.  The student will go away and come back later to see the results of this step.</p></li></ol><p>After completing all of the tasks at the RTEng position, the learner will click on Continue to move to the next inspection point.&nbsp; In Guided Mode, if the learner tries to move on without identifying a damaged component, they will be unable to leave and will be prompted to complete what has been left undone.&nbsp; If all inspection tasks have been completed, they will move to the next inspection point.</p><h2 id="ReleaseIV-AlternateTrailers-GuidedModeUserExperience-Position#3-ReeferTrailerFuelCheck(RTFuel)">Position #3 - Reefer Trailer Fuel Check (RTFuel)</h2><p>The camera will stop about midway down the driver&rsquo;s side of the reefer trailer, just past the dolly legs, with the view area focused on the fuel filler port and fuel gauge components. This will be called position RTFuel. From here, the student will be reminded about inspections that have already been done in this area, including the trailer wheels and tires, exterior lights and conspicuity tape, and the trailer brakes and suspension.  The student is then prompted by the voiceover to inspect items that are in this immediate area, which are specific to the reefer trailer.  </p><ol><li><p>Fuel gauge reading (low is anything below 1/2 but above 1/4, critically low is anything 1/4 tank or below) - <strong>student must take action to refill the reefer trailer fuel tank</strong> if it is below half.  If the student reports that the fuel level is Low or Critically Low, they will get a caution prompt similar to the one we show for the gear shift inspection, saying &ldquo;Click here to refill the fuel tank for the refrigerated trailer&rdquo;.  We don&rsquo;t need any animation or jerry can or anything, it can just magically be filled and the fuel gauge will change from Low/Critically Low up to Full. The fuel gauge should be a very simple circle gauge, it is not styled to look like the dashboard gauges. </p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/482443265/502267932.png" data-image-src="attachments/482443265/502267932.png" data-height="122" data-width="134" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="502267932" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20220722-153401.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="482443265" data-linked-resource-container-version="7" data-media-id="52deec63-ef9d-4adb-9c7f-3f6c7376c441" data-media-type="file" /></span></li><li><p>Fuel filler port (cap not tight) The most common problem with the fuel filler cap on a reefer trailer is that someone cross-threaded the cap when putting it back on.  In that situation, the cap may appear to be crooked, and is not tight.  - PHYSICAL INSPECTION User will be prompted to click the fuel cap icon. We may choose to show the hand animation similar to lug nut inspection (this is not required but might be nice) and a hint toast message will show at the top of the screen indicating &ldquo;Fuel cap is secure&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fuel cap feels loose&rdquo;.  The fuel fill port and cap basically look just like the DEF tank port and cap, except that the cap for the fuel MUST NOT BE BLUE.  Common colours are green and black, but it should not be blue.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/482443265/502235156.png" data-image-src="attachments/482443265/502235156.png" data-height="181" data-width="199" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="502235156" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20220722-154301.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="482443265" data-linked-resource-container-version="7" data-media-id="66d0c2f0-2a16-4872-8224-eba6d6569aed" data-media-type="file" /></span></li></ol><p>After completing all of the tasks at the RTFuel position, the learner will click on Continue to move to the next inspection point.&nbsp; In Guided Mode, if the learner tries to move on without identifying a damaged component, they will be unable to leave and will be prompted to complete what has been left undone.&nbsp; If all inspection tasks have been completed, they will move to the next inspection point.</p><h2 id="ReleaseIV-AlternateTrailers-GuidedModeUserExperience-Position#4-ReeferTrailerTemperature(RTTemp)">Position #4 - Reefer Trailer Temperature (RTTemp)</h2><p>The camera will return to focus on the reefer trailer control panel.&nbsp; This will be called Position RTTemp. The voiceover will remind the student that approximately 10-15 minutes have passed while the student was completing the walkaround exterior inspection of the trailer and truck, as well as the truck engine and cab interior inspections.  At this point, the refrigerator unit has been running for at least 10-15 minutes and is ready for a temperature check. The student will be prompted to inspect the control panel for the refrigerated trailer.  </p><ol><li><p>Compressor is running (not running) - the refrigeration unit makes lots of noise, like any small engine.

Debris can be tools, flashlight, or gloves, or loose packaging materials such as broken wooden pallets or cardboard boxes.</p></li><li><p>Winches and straps for load securement (winch missing, strap damaged, hook damaged, strap not secured) - Note that any type of load securement system is acceptable here, including anchors &amp; chains, straps with deck-mounted ratchets, straps with tie-down anchors and mid-strap ratchets, etc.  It isn&rsquo;t really important to focus on any particular securement system because there is a wide variety out there.  The exact number of winches and straps would depend on the type of cargo being loaded, so we won&rsquo;t focus on how many - the important thing is that the student must inspect EACH item that is present.</p></li></ol><p>Why do we inspect the load securement devices?</p><ul><li><p>Anchors, winches, and ratchet tensioning devices can get knocked right off the truck when loading or unloading large cargo from the deck.  When missing, the anchor/ratchet mounting bracket would still be attached to the deck, but it would look twisted and broken, or the entire winch would be missing including the coiled strap, leaving only the broken mounting bracket still attached to the truck)</p></li><li><p>Ratchet tensioners can be damaged (handle ripped off, run over and flattened)</p></li><li><p>Anchors can be flattened by being run over (can no longer hook a strap into it, squashed flat)</p></li><li><p>Tie down straps can be ripped (they are similar material to a seatbelt)</p></li><li><p>Straps that are not currently in use need to be tightly rolled and secured for transport.   Please note that the straps are usually brightly coloured, but can be any colour (yellow, orange, blue, white are all popular) and the winch assembly and hooks can be painted or unpainted.  I do not recommend black, even though it is a popular choice, because it is very difficult to show damage on black models.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/482443265/498008222.png" data-image-src="attachments/482443265/498008222.png" data-height="299" data-width="272" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="498008222" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20220705-214927.png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="482443265" data-linked-resource-container-version="7" data-media-id="8e9c261d-68e8-4340-9b04-e8d6cf6956a8" data-media-type="file" /></span></li></ul><p>The tiedown is secured in the anchor and the strap is wound onto a reel that is mounted below the deck of the flatbed.

In this case, the strap is still held in the winch, but the end of the strap would be hanging straight down toward the ground because it could not be hooked onto the rail or anchor to hold it.  In this case, the damage to the hook should be VERY obvious, because we do not want the student to mistakenly choose the less specific &ldquo;not secured&rdquo; answer.</p><p>When the strap is &ldquo;not secured&rdquo; it just means that it was left out on the flatbed deck instead of being properly rolled back onto the winch and stored securely.  The student must take action to securely stow any loose, unsecured straps, this can use a caution message similar to the one used for the gear shift inspection in the cab interior.<br /></p><p><br /></p>
