This section will attempt to capture those questions as they pertain to Labs 1- 5 and provide answers as we go.</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="gfegreip6t">Q: Should the student be able to go back and move/change something that they did in a previous step?</span></strong><br />A: Pedagogy expert Lisa Trimble:  No, there&rsquo;s no real educational value in going back to redo a step that has already been confirmed to be correct.  Because our workflow does not allow the student to move on until they complete the current step correctly, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for them to need to change something that was already completed successfully in a previous step.  Sometimes there can be more than one acceptable answer, so any correct answer will get the &ldquo;success&rdquo; feedback (sound effect + green checkmark) and the DLX will automatically move to the task prompt for the next step.  The user should not be able to go back and change anything after completing the step correctly.</p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>Example:  Student sets the voltage regulator dial to 10.06V in the first task of the PreLab.  They hear the &quot;success&quot; sound and get a green checkmark for that task.  The next task voiceover prompt is automatically played, and the text for that step is highlighted in the instruction panel.  As soon as these events take place, the voltage regulator dial is no longer accessible and cannot be adjusted by the student. The voltage regulator dial will not be accessible again, unless the student is required to adjust it in a future step of the lab procedure.</p></div></div><p><strong><span data-colorid="g103af8wrr">Q: Do the steps in each Lab need to be done in order?</span></strong><br />A: Yes, this is the only way we can give meaningful feedback.  When the current task is highlighted in the instruction panel, we will assume that the student is working to complete THAT step.  If the student does anything other than the current task, they will get the &ldquo;try again&rdquo; sound effect and a red X feedback so that they know they did not complete the current task successfully.  It is theoretically possible that a student could (on purpose or accidentally) complete some future step of the lab procedure, while they are supposed to be working on an earlier step.  This will not be recognized by the DLX (they will not get a checkmark for step 5 if they happen to complete that step while they are working on step 2).  All user actions will be evaluated on the basis of the current task only.</p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>Example: Student is prompted to connect a red lead from the Battery + terminal to L1.  For some reason, the student connects a black lead from the Battery - terminal to L1 (which is what they will be prompted to do next, after successfully connecting L1 to the positive rail).  We don&rsquo;t know if the student is doing this on purpose, because they are choosing to connect the negative side of the circuit first, or if the student accidentally chose the wrong colour lead and mistakenly connected it to Battery - instead of +.  In order to provide meaningful feedback, we will show &ldquo;try again&rdquo; feedback for the current task (&ldquo;try again&rdquo; sound effect + red X feedback) and we will NOT show &ldquo;success&rdquo; feedback for the future task.  The only task that will get any feedback is the CURRENT task.<br /></p></div></div><p><strong><span data-colorid="rqtq4bbyfb">Q: The CE&rsquo;s provided circuit diagrams for each of Labs 1-5.  Do these diagrams need to dynamically update to reflect each step of the Lab procedure?</span></strong><br />A: No. &nbsp;Stacey originally thought it would be really cool for the circuit diagrams to be updated as the student progresses through the steps, helping the student identify which specific lines and symbols on the circuit diagram represent which specific leads and components on the board. This seemed like a cool idea, but was far too complex to implement using the simple diagrams provided by the CE&rsquo;s.  It wasn&rsquo;t clear how to visually indicate connections that were completed on the board vs ones that are required but not yet completed, and there was a lot of confusion about how to represent every step of a lab that starts out with one circuit and then modifies that circuit into something else (this happens in Lab 2 and beyond).  Stacey reviewed the circuit diagram behaviour with CE Adam Jarosz and pedagogy expert Dr. Lisa Trimble and determined that there was <u>no need to update or highlight the circuit diagram in any way</u>.  What the CE&rsquo;s originally asked for was to display the circuit diagram, so that is what we will do.  Just display it and not make any updates or changes to it - it will just be a visual reference for the student to look at it if they want to.</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="jwgjdc10xr">Q: Should the connections on board be animated in some way to show the directional flow of electricity through the circuit?</span></strong><br />A: No. This was another fun idea that proved inappropriate on further examination.  The &ldquo;flow&rdquo; animation was inspired by the old Hydraulics lab, which would show directional motion of hydraulic fluid through a similar type of circuit trainer board.  However, fluid and electricity do not work the same way, and direction of flow was not deemed to be a useful data point for the MP Circuits students.  CE&rsquo;s rejected the idea, so it has been removed from the user experience definiton.</p>
