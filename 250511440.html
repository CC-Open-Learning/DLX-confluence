                    <p><strong>Character Choices</strong> </p><p>In the beginning of the project, we wanted to make our own character in Aseprite and bring it into RPG Maker. We wanted it to be ambiguous what gender the character was so anyone could identify with them. </p><p> </p><p>After a day, we decided against the idea for multiple reasons. First, the character would need to match the rest of the characters in RPG Maker or else we'd need to make every single character. Second, RPG Maker already has a decent character creation system inside it already so we could just use it. It also created portraits and full animation sheets, making it much easier.  </p><p> </p><p>We didn't completely disregard the character idea, it would be good to have it be completely unique to the game, but it wasn't possible in our timeframe. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Battles</strong> </p><p>Battles were decided against early on, at least traditional battles. The idea was then always to change how it functioned to be more appropriate for school, such as studying, the enemy itself would be a textbook or something along those lines. </p><p>The idea was never further expanded upon or investigated. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Progression</strong> </p><p>Normally, in JRPGs you move from town to town fighting battles and progressing in strength and ability to fight bigger and better monsters. Since battles aren't a key component of this game, progression is done through mission completion and exploration. </p><p> </p><p>For example, whenever major missions are completed, the party gains a level. This will encourage the player to complete missions and since these missions are more or less Conestoga tutorials, the goal of the game is achieved.  </p><p> </p><p>In this tutorial, the missions get progressively more vague, going from one end of the school to the other, and then in the middle of the school and then finding a specific room. It's still simple, because again, we want the player to be able to complete this game with relative ease. </p><p> </p><p>Most missions must be done in order, aside from Ellie's Student Services mission since that is a side quest. For now, the reward is that Ellie accompanies you. What this means for the future adventure is unknown. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Expansion</strong> </p><p>There are so many ways for us to expand this project. It's already rooted in simple progression, going from mission to mission that takes the player to a different part of the school. Add more missions, more rooms until the entirety of Conestoga Doon Campus is complete. And when that's done, why not move over to the exterior, maybe the other buildings around Doon Campus. </p><p> </p><p>This idea doesn't need to be constricted to Doon campus though, a bus station could transport the player from Doon to the Waterloo Campus, or the Cambridge Campus. Maybe the player could start the game deciding which campus they are attending.  </p><p> </p><p>Again, there is the possibility for some sort of battle system to be implemented but the details need to be decided. It's a major part of any JRPG and some sort of inclusion would definitely make the game more compelling. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Map Layout</strong> </p><ul><li><p>The map is not 1:1 to real life, it's fitted to fit with the RPG aesthetic </p></li><li><p>Hallways will be 4 tiles wide **Generally, this rule is broken when certain areas should be larger than others, for example, the Condor's nest is much larger in comparison to what's around it </p></li><li><p>Each wall is 2 tiles tall and then a ceiling tile on top, this is except for the CSI room located in Building A, this is to simulate the windows </p></li><li><p>Wall tiles are only visible from the front, otherwise they are ceiling tiles </p></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><p>Each Building and floor has its own map, this is to differentiate them more in the player's minds </p><ul><li><p>The above statement is true for all but 2A, which is much larger than any other building, It already has two areas in the services section and classes section, these will be how it is separated in-game </p></li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><p>The maps aren't overcrowded. Many of the decorations are placed along walls so they do not collide with the player anyway </p></li><li><p>There are many small details placed throughout the maps, about 95% of them are assets made by us while the rest are made from RPG Maker. Most of those assets are found in A Building </p></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><p>The CSI section of building A is quite different from real life, the angled hallway is slightly angled but the CSI services and Tim Hortons are now vertical  </p><ul><li><p>The sizes and locations of rooms are more or less the same, with some alterations to make the overall size of the map smaller </p></li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><p>A small bit of the loading dock interior is built, the player will never go here so there is no point in building it out </p></li><li><p>There are hallways that lead to dead ends, this was to save time and only build the important areas the player would need to visit </p></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><p>The library is used solely for a cutscene, because of this the room is incredibly small </p></li><li><p>NPCs are dotted throughout the maps for comedic relief, instructions and to give more life into these areas </p></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Quest Choices</strong> </p><p> </p><ul><li><p>The maps are restricted in the beginning of the demo, this is because the One Card is incredibly important for a student to obtain which is why it should be instant </p><ul><li><p>Most of these blocks are students, each with their own dialogue. They disappear when conditions are met, in this case when the one card is obtained </p></li></ul></li><li><p>The player purposefully walks from one end of the map to the other to for easier pathfinding, which is why the third quest is in the middle of the overall map </p></li><li><p>The player must walk past the security desk to get to the book store, this is why Nichkolas mentions it specifically in how to find the library </p></li><li><p>Nichkolas bluntly explains what the numbers and letters mean for a room number, this is done on purpose to make sure everyone is able to understand. This is mixed with the player searching for the room on their own so that the information sticks. </p></li></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Event Details (For more specifics, check the Quests Page)</strong> </p><ul><li><p>Events are placed all around the levels for both important and side content </p></li><li><p>We need to emphasize interactivity, since the game is mostly walking around campus talking with NPCs, random interactable objects adds extra brevity and comedy </p></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><p>Hidden information can be placed in events </p><ul><li><p>At the beginning of the game, there is an opening cutscene, the player is given $100 here </p></li></ul></li><li><p>The game is meant to be very linear in the beginning so there are roadblocks in the areas the player shouldn't go, these events range from objects to characters </p></li><li><p>NPC events change depending on the player's current actions and quests </p><ul><li><p>Ideally, in the beginning specifically, the NPCs guide the player through their quests, meaning that their dialogue becomes outdated whenever they complete the quest </p></li><li><p>The same goes for certain objects, it depends how funny they are to be honest. </p></li></ul></li><li><p>NPCs may or may not have portraits, with the amount of students in the game, it isn't worth designing characters for each and every one  </p><ul><li><p>Plus, if they have a portrait, the player might think they're important when they aren't </p></li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><p>Events are placed in certain sections to tell the player what to do, such as the opening where there are three tiles for all the spots the player can move, telling them to get the one card </p><ul><li><p>The same is done for the supplies quest </p></li></ul><p> </p></li><li><p>Each event is named appropriately, if it is a duplicate, there is a bracket added afterward with a number to indicate which version is it, it goes *name* *name(1)* *name(2)* and so on </p><ul><li><p>This was dropped in the final days, so in this current build, many are named incorrectly </p></li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><p>Opening scene has two events, one for the player character in the middle of the screen and another in the top right that runs automatically, at the end it teleports the player to the first actual map </p><ul><li><p>The player is also given money here </p></li></ul></li><li><p>There are many events around all the book store entrances to allow the player to continue the game no matter where they step </p><ul><li><p>This event checks for an item rather than a variable, it works in the exact same way </p></li></ul><p> </p></li><li><p>Ellie cutscene is two events, one for the player to interact with and begin the event, the second holds the image and continued dialogue for Ellie </p></li><li><p>Library event is a single cutscene that runs automatically </p></li></ul><p> </p><ul><li><p>Game is just a prototype demo, but there is an ending because we wanted to have one. This is achieved by completing all the objectives </p><ul><li><p>The idea is that the character goes home and would come back later for more events and quests, but for this demo, the game ends </p></li></ul></li></ul>
