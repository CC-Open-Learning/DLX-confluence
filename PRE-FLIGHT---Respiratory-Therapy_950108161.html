Even though we know we won&rsquo;t have all of the art assets that we need to finish this segment, we&rsquo;ve decided to start our development effort with this segment because we are confident about how it should work. The general look and feel of the Equipment Orientation segment for RT will somewhat resemble the &ldquo;Explore mode&rdquo; workflow for AMB. Here are some notes about what we know so far:</p><p><strong>ALL IN ONE MODULE</strong> - We previously thought that we would publish different segments of this DLX as individual WebGL modules, but Corey wants everything in one module with a big menu to allow students to browse through all available segments.  Due to increased file size, this could result in slightly longer load times, but this is normal and we will do our best to optimize.</p><p><strong>Equipment Orientation is only in Guided mode </strong>(there is no advanced version of this segment).</p><p><span data-colorid="kemrp8hn2m">Setting:</span> This can be done in an empty room for now. &nbsp;We can find out later if the setup should take place in a supply area or at the patient bedside or a procedure room or what.</p><p><span data-colorid="webn1wress">Camera/Navigation:</span> First person POV, stationary camera. &nbsp;No navigation, we only need pan &amp; zoom for this segment.&nbsp;</p><p><span data-colorid="dd44lgajrs">Character(s): </span>No Patient or Physician NPCs are required for the equipment orientation. Mentor NPC can be voiceover at this stage, we can decide later if/how we want to represent that character in the scene.</p><ul><li><p>There are no procedural steps (no tasks, no prompts, no feedback, no playtimer) required for this segment.</p></li><li><p>Progress is just an organized (expandable?) list of all items. &nbsp;When the learner clicks on an item, that item gets a checkmark in the list. Segment is &quot;complete&quot; when all items have been clicked on at least once. &nbsp;There is no limit to how many times a learner can explore the same POI or the same item, this is an unlimited segment.</p></li><li><p>Two main POI's for this scene are: <strong>Bronch Tower</strong> and <strong>Supplies</strong>.</p></li><li><p>For the Bronch Tower, the equipment will be front and centre in the scene, with hover highlight on the interactable parts and hover tooltips to display the name of the highlighted item. &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>For the Supplies, we will use an expandable menu of some kind along with the Object Viewer. &nbsp;Object Viewer is perfect for this interaction because it allows the learner to turn the 3D model over and look at the label as well as looking at the item itself. Every object in the menu will be labelled with its name, and will highlight on hover. When selected, the item will be launched in the Object Viewer to allow the learner to inspect it more closely, as well as displaying detailed information (name + other info, such as what it is used for).  From a learning perspective, we chose NOT to put the supplies into the scene during the Orientation segment because we do not want students to accidentally memorize items by location (3rd drawer down on the left) instead of learning to recognize supplies using their label, appearance, and use.  There are many options for how the supplies menu might be styled or laid out or organized, and we can decide that later.</p></li><li><p>The learner can click on each explorable item (part, button, port, whatever) to get detailed information (name + other info, such as what it is used for. A &quot;listen&quot; icon of some kind will be available so that the learner can hear the item name read by the voiceover. &nbsp;We may optionally include another &quot;listen&quot; icon for the other information, in case we want voiceover for that too. &nbsp;For now, the info can go into a dialog similar to the one used in AMB - we don't know exactly how this info will be styled in the finished scene yet, but we can decide later. The AMB dialog can be a placeholder while we are getting started. </p></li><li><p>Save &amp; Load will save progress checklist only in the Equipment Orientation segment.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Aug 7, 2024</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Meeting with Stacey, Nilupul, Corey (Introducing Nilupul to the project)</p><ul><li><p>At least 3 modules are expected: &nbsp;Orientation, Guided Bronchoscopy Procedure, Advanced Bronchoscopy Procedure</p><ul><li><p>Orientation: Recognize and know the use of the bronch tower equipment and supplies</p></li><li><p>Bronchoscopy Procedure modules: Scenarios and tasks are identical for both modules, but Guided has more learner supports enabled such as task prompts, task help, and enriched feedback.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Save &amp; Load will be at the task level.</p></li><li><p>No need for navigation in this DLX, user does not move around the space.</p></li><li><p>Standard audio settings and camera controls are appropriate for this DLX</p></li><li><p>We may wish to include Guidance selector in the Settings menu so that a learner could choose more/less guidance, if multiple levels of guidance are included in the design</p></li><li><p>Storyboarding will begin with scenario definition - the focus will be on defining the scenarios (tasks,decisions) so that we can manage user pathing and make the scenarios as modular and reusable as possible, with appropriate variations to serve the learning objectives.</p></li><li><p>Visual elements of storyboarding should use VELCRO UI library as the basis for user interactions such as menus, feedback, just the basic UI elements that will be needed for all scenarios.
