introduction of Advanced Mode (including an upgraded Tutorial to help learners understand how to navigate and succeed in Advanced Mode).  This document describes only the order of events for Guided Mode, because the learner will control their own progression through the inspection in Advanced Mode.  This order of events does not apply to Advanced Mode.  Various descriptions of the user experience for Advanced Mode are provided on this page - it is only the ORDER of events that can be disregarded for Advanced Mode.</p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>Changes from Release I or new inspections introduced in Release II are highlighted in blue text.</p></div></div><p>Order of Inspection steps for Guided Mode in Release II of the Trucking Pre-Trip Inspection simulation:</p><h2 id="ReleaseII-GuidedModeUserExperience-InitialViewandWelcome"><span data-colorid="oidvm7i8zh">Initial View and Welcome</span></h2><p>On initial load, the camera will approach the vehicle as though the student is walking towards it from a distance of approx 20-40m. This is from the student's point of view, at approx eye level, lasting no more than a few seconds to help orient the learner to the simulation environment. </p><p>The voiceover will welcome the student and advise them to follow the prompts to practice a walk-around inspection of the truck and trailer exterior.  Students will be prompted to observe each inspectable item in order. </p><h2 id="ReleaseII-GuidedModeUserExperience-CameraBehaviourandNavigation"><span data-colorid="s5iuefgsb9">Camera Behaviour and Navigation</span></h2><p>In Guided Mode, the camera will move automatically for each inspection, there will be no need for the learner to navigate manually using either keyboard or mouse.  The Guided Mode inspection walks the student through the inspection process so that the student does not decide what to inspect or in what order.  For certain views, we will consider the optional use of camera pan and zoom, but the objective will always be to ensure that the learner can see whatever they need to inspect without fiddling around with the camera.</p><p><span data-colorid="vpqo3nfjny">In Advanced Mode, the learner will have much more freedom in terms of camera movement.  We will consider the option of providing a Views menu, to allow the learner to quickly navigate to a specific area of the truck, or we could allow free movement via Move controls or arrow/WASD keyboard navigation around the truck.  The Physical Inspections tray will show up whenever a learner enters a designated POI area, and it will update or disappear when the learner exits that area.  While a learner is in a POI area (e.g. tires) they can use the Next Inspection button on the toolbar to conveniently cycle through all of the inspection tasks at this  POI (e.g. rim/sidewall/lug nuts, tread check, tire pressure, etc) until they have completed all of the available tasks at that POI. At that point, the student will click Next Inspection to be returned to the default camera location for this POI, where they can select a new POI.</span></p><h2 id="ReleaseII-GuidedModeUserExperience-InteractionModel"><span data-colorid="pjj970yzbx">Interaction Model</span></h2><p>There are two types of inspections in this simulation: Visual and Physical.  </p><p><strong>Visual inspections</strong> are passive - they require no special view or extra action to identify the condition of the component being inspected.  Examples of visual inspections would include Windows, Mirrors, and Exterior Condition.</p><p><strong>Physical inspections</strong> are active - these inspections require a specialized view (not the default view for the position where they occur) and may also require a simulated action.  Examples of physical inspections would include Wheels and Tires, Van Doors, and Brakes. To trigger a physical inspection, the learner will be prompted to click on the icon in the Physical Inspection menu.  Some physical inspections are also tactile inspections, where the student is prompted to FEEL something, such as the temperature of the air blowing from the defroster or the pressure of the brake pedal when they press it with their foot.  Tactile inspections are signalled by the use of a hand or foot avatar on screen, and on-screen messages will explain to the student what they are &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; with descriptive text, e.g. &ldquo;The air is blowing, but it feels cold.&rdquo; or &ldquo;The brake pedal feels firm when pressed down with your foot&rdquo;.</p><p>Note: At each position of the inspection process, only the applicable icons will be available in the physical inspection tray.  These icons will change as the learner progresses to each stage of the inspection, so that the icon tray doesn&rsquo;t get too crowded or overwhelming.</p><p>For all inspection interactions, the learner will observe the virtual truck model to evaluate the condition of the component, and will have two options for how to respond:  Report Damage or Continue.</p><p><strong>Report Damage:</strong> If the learner sees something wrong (or questionable), they will click on the item.  Clicking on the model will trigger the Inspection UI dialogue box, which will provide selectable options for what types of damage/wear could occur for this component.  These options are customized for each component, so that only applicable options are displayed for the specific component (ie. tires will offer options such as excessive tread wear or embedded object, while lights will offer options such as cracked or burnt out).  In Guided Mode, the learner will have immediate feedback when they select an option from the Inspection UI - the background colour of the option they select will change to green (if they have correctly identified the state of the component) or it will change to red (if they have incorrectly identified the state of the component).  The learner will have the opportunity to change their answer as many times as they need to, until they get the &ldquo;green&rdquo; result.  Note that the Inspection UI is ONLY used for reporting damage/wear.  There is no option in the dialog to report that a component is in good condition.</p><p><strong>Next Inspection (Nothing to Report):</strong> If the learner does not see anything wrong with the component under inspection, they will click the &ldquo;Next Inspection&rdquo; button in the toolbar to move on to the next component. This will prevent the learner from having to report components that are in good condition, which will make the inspection process true to real-life practice where only damage/wear is reported. In Guided Mode, the student will not be allowed to move on while there is unreported damage/wear.  If they fail to report damage that is present, the voiceover will prompt them to take a closer look, and will remind them about what to look for.  If the learner has successfully identified all damage/wear for a particular inspectable component, the Next Inspection button will move them to the next inspectable component at this position.  When all components at a particular position have been inspected successfully, the Next Inspection button will move the learner to the next position.</p><h2 id="ReleaseII-GuidedModeUserExperience-ProgressandFeedback"><span data-colorid="iu6m017hx2">Progress and Feedback</span></h2><p>In Guided Mode, there is immediate feedback about answers being correct or incorrect, and the student is unable to proceed to the next step without completing all required tasks at each POI. For this reason, the Progress Checklist and Results Panel are not particularly useful in Guided Mode.</p><p><span data-colorid="ct7qbqesv0">In Advanced Mode, the Progress Checklist and Results Panel will both be used to provide guidance and feedback to the student, as follows:</span></p><p><strong><span data-colorid="hjmlnh5pyn">Progress Checklist</span></strong><span data-colorid="knkumbwhkx"> - The primary function of the Progress Checklist is to help the student identify what they have already completed in their inspection workflow, and what is left to be done.  Inspection tasks/results will be presented in the order of the Guided Mode progression of tasks, to help reinforce an efficient and best-practice workflow, without requiring students to follow that set order.  Sub-tasks within a particular grouping can be expanded to show more detailed information.  For example, at the highest level, the checklist might appear as a single page, with only top-level inspection tasks shown, such as Driver&rsquo;s Side Front, Driver&rsquo;s Side Cab, etc.  If a category is marked as complete, it means that all of the subtasks under that category are complete.  We can also show partially completed and &ldquo;to do&rdquo; status for categories, so that the student can quickly see if they have completed all of the necessary inspection workflow steps before submitting their inspection.  It is important to keep in mind that students can perform the inspection tasks in any order when in Advanced Mode, so it will be much easier for them to skip a step or forget to inspect something.  The checklist will help them keep track. The Progress Checklist is available in the bottom left toolbar at all times, the user can view it whenever they want.  The checklist cannot be used to navigate or to change inspection answers - it is a read-only progress indicator.   The Progress Checklist does not indicate if answers are correct or incorrect, and does not need to provide any details about what damages have been reported.  The student is free to revisit any part of the inspection at any time, so they can review/change their answers by simply revisiting a POI.</span></p><p><strong><span data-colorid="p45uo2ckv9">Results Panel</span></strong><span data-colorid="xww4benmhb"> - Advanced Mode does not provide any immediate feedback to the learner about their selected answer for any of the inspection tasks.  Instead, feedback comes at the very end of the Advanced Mode user experience, when the student finalizes their inspection report and &ldquo;submits&rdquo; the inspection for evaluation.  At this point, the student will be shown a complete list of every inspection task (these may be organized in a familiar way that is consistent with the Progress Checklist, to help the student find what they are looking for) where each task will be given one of THREE results:</span></p><ul><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="yda0pr2abd">Green checkmark</span></strong> - This task was completed successfully. The selected answer is the correct answer.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="d555pkp8cc">Red X</span></strong><span data-colorid="qex6oi2oa4"> </span>- This task was completed, but the answer selected was incorrect.

There is no such thing as oil pressure being too high.</span></p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="x31msoh9ve">Fuel gauge (low, critically low) - gauge reading between 1/4 and 1/2 tank is low, less than 1/4 tank is critically low.</span></p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="oyvfxswaos">DEF gauge (low, critically low) - same as fuel gauge for low and critically low.</span></p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="bre37noq3e">Air pressure gauge (low, high) - there are TWO air pressure gauges because there are two separate tanks. The tanks fill in sequence, so it is normal for Air Pressure 1 to read higher than (while filling) or the same as (after filling) Air Pressure 2.  If either tank reads 50 PSI or below, that is &ldquo;air pressure low&rdquo;. If either tank reads 125 PSI or above, that is &ldquo;air pressure high&rdquo;.  Both the high and low zones of the gauge should be red.</span></p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="swqpxudi30">Volt meter (low) - this can be analog or digital. Reading of less than 12 is &ldquo;low&rdquo;</span></p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="lh52xe39yj">Warning lights (stay on) - all warning lights come on briefly when the instrument panel is initialized. They will take anywhere from 1-30 seconds to go out after being initialized. Warning lights that remain on by the time the student has completed the exterior inspection should be noted on the inspection results checklist.</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><span data-colorid="mr9ru048za">Windshield wipers and washer (comes on when activated, cleans windshield) - PHYSICAL INSPECTION (click the Wipers icon)</span></p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="iar3muukin">Heater and defroster (activated previously) - PHYSICAL INSPECTION (click the Heater icon) This one is tricky because it isn&rsquo;t enough for the defroster vents to blow, the student needs to verify that the air coming from the vent is warm.  We can animate a hand that reaches over the dashboard to feel the air that is blowing from the defroster vents, and use a toast/voiceover hint to indicate &ldquo;The vents are blowing cold air, the defroster isn&rsquo;t working&rdquo; or &ldquo;The vents are blowing nice warm air, this seems to be working well&rdquo;.</span></p></li><li><p><span data-colorid="conkk9te68">Air Horn (pull cable) and City Horn (press centre of steering wheel) - PHYSICAL INSPECTION (click the Horn icons)</span></p></li></ol><p><span data-colorid="eilm9j19bn">After completing all of the tasks at the CAB2 position, the learner will click on Continue to complete the inspection.  The voiceover will congratulate the learner on completing the inspection successfully, and the inspection checklist will be shown.  Note that the inspection checklist is available for viewing at any point during the inspection simulation, just by clicking on the checklist icon in the bottom toolbar.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
