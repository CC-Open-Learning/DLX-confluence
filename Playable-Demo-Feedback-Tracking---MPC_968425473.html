Instead of reviewing the GR builds, we focused on reviewing the Release Notes, particularly the Known Issues section, and discussing post-release deployment plans.  Key points summarized below:</p><ul><li><p><a class="external-link" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx?prevorigin=shell&amp;origin=NeoPortalPage&amp;subpage=design&amp;id=OjndTYrpBESEH8S-zdklpcvsDfKVYHJMpLGgvisaotJUOTZSRElNUVcwRjhWM1dGWTc3TjY1MVhTVC4u&amp;analysis=true" rel="nofollow">Student feedback surveys for Labs 1-5</a> were reviewed - 22 responses in all and results were overwhelmingly positive.  Other than feedback from 2 students who observed that the DLX is not playable on an iPad, and one student who believes that the layout of the trainer board is not optimal and should be rearranged, the students felt that the DLX modules were easy to use, helpful, had excellent learning value, and did not have any quality issues.  Many students commented that they would appreciate more of a free-play opportunity and a greater challenge, which is a strong indicator that we were right on track with Labs 6-9 (which these survey participants had not had an opportunity to play).</p></li><li><p>Release Notes contained a terminology error in the Known Issues section, for MPC-755.  The document should say “current flow” instead of “resistance” when describing the type of measurement in question.  This problem was quickly fixed during the meeting and the review was completed at that time.</p></li><li><p>The model course shell was reviewed, and a typo was identified on one page where the manufacturer of the trainer board was incorrectly spelled as “Compulab” when it should be “Consulab”.  This was quickly fixed during the meeting and I searched all other pages  and the Release Notes to check for that error.</p></li><li><p>I explained that the General Release of the Circuilt Builder 1.0 modules had been approved by VLT (and Adam confirmed his approval again in the meeting) so I confirmed that the modules were now available in the DLX model course shell.  I confirmed that I would send an email to Adam, Kevin Bell, and Bill Adams to formally announce the release and provide links and documentation to help with deployment. I specified that any other faculty or staff that require access to the model shell just need to be added to the classlist and they will immediately have copy access. I confirmed that I remain available by Teams, email, or by phone to discuss any questions or concerns that might come up post-release.</p></li><li><p>Confirmed that the Playable Demo course shell would be taken down (we reuse them for other projects).</p></li><li><p>Confirmed that our usual interval for checking back with a program/school for opportunities to refresh or expand on their DLX content is approx 12-18 months, or whenever needed.</p></li><li><p>The meeting concluded with lots of thanks and appreciation all around, I confirmed that there would be no more scheduled meetings after today, but that Adam or any member of his team could reach out anytime.</p></li></ul><h2 id="PlayableDemoFeedbackTracking-MPC-10APR2024-CEfeedbackfrom:AdamJarosz">10 APR 2024 - CE feedback from: Adam Jarosz</h2><p>Builds <a class="external-link" href="https://stuconestogacon.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/VARLab/ElzXCIRUdW1CoOUi1wFbB80BOZezlDkqxaQyZltjtNSJxw?e=4uMYFS" rel="nofollow">S24-7 Interim build 09APR2024 - Playable demo</a></p><p>Note: Stacey was not available, meeting was chaired by David Inglis, these are their notes</p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-table-width="950" data-layout="default" data-local-id="9b0226fa-c086-4f6b-8134-2a46cc2a4f6b" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 476.0px;"/><col style="width: 474.0px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><th data-highlight-colour="#b3d4ff" class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Stakeholder Feedback</strong></p></th><th data-highlight-colour="#b3d4ff" class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Jira Ticket Number(s)</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>Multimeter display is slightly off, decimal is too far to the right.

This is because we assumed 50 Ohms of resistance for each bulb, but the actual resistance of an incandescent bulb will vary based on the brightness of the bulb.  This difference is not much of a concern for one light bulb because it is within the expected range. However, when there are 2 light bulbs connected in series, they are sharing the source voltage and are therefore dimmer, therefore reducing their resistance.  Each light is approx 33 Ohms of resistance when there are 2 connected in series.  This ends up with an <strong>inaccurate result when you do the lab on the digital twin</strong> vs the real life trainer board, which can confuse students.</p><p>The same problem affects Lab 7, but it is less noticeable because the bulbs are connected in parallel instead of in series. Solving the resistance for Lab 6 would also solve it for Lab 7.</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>
