                    <p>There are three major ways of displaying information for elements that needs inspection throughout our simulation</p><ol><li><p>Images</p></li><li><p>Gifs</p></li><li><p>Videos</p></li></ol><p><strong>What is the difference in using these methods?</strong></p><p>Each method that we utilize has its own pros and cons and is necessary to represent different types of inspection based on their strengths. They have their own benefit but also time associated with making it available for the devs to utilize.</p><p>The various pros and cons for the various methods shall be stated below.</p><h2 id="Inspectionelement&#39;svisualrepresentationinUI-1.Images"><strong>1. Images</strong></h2><p>Use of images are the most basic thing we can use in showing good as-well as bad states for the inspection elements</p><p>example: (Will be Uploaded when it is ready)</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Images can be easily obtained especially for good-state of our inspection</p></li><li><p>Images can easily be manipulated to create bad-state by adding 2D decals</p></li><li><p>The time required to make these edits is  less especially compared to video editing</p></li><li><p>The decals needed to add to the images are also readily available from massive sources online.</p></li><li><p>Images are relatively easy to load and will keep the sim lighter</p></li><li><p>Most of the inspections can be done with this method be it the good or the bad state</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Images, though informative, it doesn't give a very lively feeling. It makes for a less immersive experience in comparison to a gif or a video.</p></li></ul><p>Images can be edited in free image editing software like Photopea which is a free alternative to Adobe Photoshop, which makes this method quite cost-effective</p><h2 id="Inspectionelement&#39;svisualrepresentationinUI-2.Gifs"><strong>2. Gifs</strong></h2><p>Gifs are just an extra flare on an image. The whole idea is to utilize the base image and have elements that are actively inspected to be shown with more immersion. Gifs are basically a series of images that have alpha present in them thus helping overlay themselves on base images or videos.</p><p>example: (Will be Uploaded when it is ready)'</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Gifs are more immersive and can be utilized to show malfunctions that need active observation like smokes, electrical faults, leaks or gauge measurements, etc.</p></li><li><p>Gifs are just an advanced Image sequence that can include audio within its application</p></li><li><p>Gifs can be less intensive than a full video to be incorporated and still tells a story, it is a blend of using images or videos</p></li><li><p>Gifs can be manipulated using free online software like <a class="external-link" href="https://www.photopea.com/?utm_source=homescreen" rel="nofollow">photopea</a>, <a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://ezgif.com/" rel="nofollow">https://ezgif.com/</a> , <a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://www.flexclip.com/learn/add-gif-to-image.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.flexclip.com/learn/add-gif-to-image.html</a> , etc. which are easy to learn and implement.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Gifs have fewer resources than Images that can be utilized well.</p></li><li><p>Gifs sometimes require quite some more work than images in editing the background out from what we require</p></li><li><p>Gifs can require more computing than images but surely less than videos</p></li></ul><p /><h2 id="Inspectionelement&#39;svisualrepresentationinUI-3.Videos"><strong>3. Videos</strong></h2><p>Videos are one of the best ways we can show immersion to the user. It is one of the best ways we can show a user the good state of an object and how it should actually look in a working condition.</p><p>example: (Will be Uploaded when it is ready)'</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Videos are good for showing most of the good states</p></li><li><p>Videos are the most immersive for a user and can actually contain a lot of information that can meet the learning objective of the user</p></li><li><p>The user has the ability to see the object in a more realistic manner where it can have more angles</p></li><li><p>Videos can have proper audio which makes for a splendid learning experience for the user</p></li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Videos can only show most good states, but bad states need to be edited onto the videos</p></li><li><p>Though the bad states can be shown in the video too, the original object needs to be tracked in a Video compositing software like Adobe after effects which needs to be purchased and it requires multiple setups done to make things look believable</p></li><li><p>It is a very time-consuming process to make such video edits compared to image or gif edits</p></li><li><p>Videos might not be readily available and might need more space on the repo</p></li><li><p>Videos also might take longer to load for the user</p></li></ul><p />
