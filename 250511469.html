                    <p><strong>Monday, April 19, 2021</strong> </p><ul><li><p>Sprite quality will be simple, similar to the Game Boy Pokémon games </p></li><li><p>College will not be 1:1, that would be too large with too much walking </p><ul><li><p>Some locations will also have changes, like diagonal stairs will be changed to be horizontal or vertical </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Many individual rooms won't be laid out, a classroom's a classroom, as long as you can find your way to it, that's what matters </p></li><li><p>We may or may not try for exterior environments, as of right now it's not on the agenda </p><ul><li><p>We realize that it would be helpful to have the other Conestoga buildings and offices but we aren't sure how fast the art will be produced </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Aseprite will be used for all sprite-work </p></li><li><p>Gameplay will see the player exploring the campus, collecting items and talking with NPCs </p></li><li><p>A combat replacement may or may not be investigated </p></li><li><p>The plan this week is to have the first section of the game created which includes at least two missions </p></li><li><p>For the purposes of this two weeks, store names can stay the same </p></li><li><p>We can block off certain areas students won't need to visit with profs or signs </p></li><li><p>We want to focus on a student's first days, missions will involve finding supplies or finding their classrooms </p></li><li><p>What did we have trouble with on our first few days? </p><ul><li><p>Getting parking pass </p></li><li><p>Finding food vendors </p></li><li><p>Finding classrooms </p></li><li><p>Finding specific facilities like the den, library or others </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Need to use a VAR lab Steam account to download RPG Maker </p></li><li><p>A mission could be finding the den with friends </p></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Tuesday, April 20, 2021</strong> </p><ul><li><p>We need to focus on the most important tiles in the coming days, such as walls, doors and tables </p></li><li><p>RPG Maker may already have some good stuff we can use instead </p><ul><li><p>Update: It had a couple of good stuff </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Title screen size doesn't matter, it just needs to be a png </p></li><li><p>You can have an event delete itself, it's already a function within RPG Maker </p></li><li><p>Currently there's a nice tune for the school, it's Town 5 with the pitch set to 90%, there is also background noise of students </p></li><li><p>Character sprites are 48x48 minimum, but can go higher, still not sure how RPG Maker manages animation sheets </p></li><li><p>Em has made Mark in RPG Maker, we will definitely be using this </p></li><li><p>Our own custom tiles are using RPG Maker rules </p><ul><li><p>We hope that this will allow us to smoothly implement them, there has been some weird issues with it so far, and it seems that they need to be very specific, whether or not the names matter has yet to be determined, one video said they did but I'm unsure </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Update to the character stuff, we're gonna put that on the nice to have list, it's way more important that the player knows where they are and that requires assets that RPG Maker doesn't have. We will just make characters using the sprites they have laid out for us </p><ul><li><p>It was also worrying because it might not have matched with the rest of RPG Maker's characters, and if we made one, we might've needed to make them all </p></li></ul></li><li><p>One card spot has been officially found by Em </p></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Wednesday, April 21, 2021</strong> </p><ul><li><p>Large discussion on perspective today </p><ul><li><p>The perspective should be facing northward in real life. It works well for the purposes of this prototype and we feel works well with the rest of the school </p><ul><li><p>We think that there will be enough visual appeal facing north that it's worth it to hide the rest </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Doors and important locations will be designated with some sort of symbol, similar to the rugs used in 2D Pokémon games </p><ul><li><p>It is important to label each and every door as that is the whole point of the game. If a door is to the south, a rug will be put in place to signify there is a door there they can interact with </p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>We will be moving headstrong with the One Card Quest for the coming days, focusing solely on the Condor's Nest and immediate surrounding area. We will also be building a certain section of A wing second floor, the area with the book store </p><ul><li><p>As of this moment, there is no plan to build out the entire book store, there isn't really a point when a simple vendor would get the job done. Remember, this is just a prototype to help students find their way around school. If they know where the book store is, then mission accomplished. </p></li></ul></li><li><p>One possible expansion we could have in terms of locations is the welcome center as many people need to visit, usually for unfortunate reasons. Personally, I went inside once but knowing how the process inside works could be vital information for students. At the very least it's something to think about. </p></li><li><p>For now, we are only going to build rooms that are important to the quests (I realize I say this after saying we aren't building the book store), as long as they know the rest of the rooms, it's a win. </p></li><li><p>Another expansion would be revising the battle system to be more school appropriate, perhaps with studying instead of fighting </p></li><li><p>Different campuses could be accessed through a recreation of the bus station </p></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Thursday, April 22, 2021</strong> </p><ul><li><p>This is kind of obvious, but it's a decision so... no fantasy skin tones. RPG Maker's character creator has a selection of many different colours but for our purposes we want to keep it realistic </p><ul><li><p>Representation is also very important as Conestoga so we need to highlight that by having diversity in our characters.  </p></li><li><p>Unfortunately we're stuck with what RPG Maker has and it's more limited on clothing, maybe there're plugins though. </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Don't forget that for each bit of dialogue you need to assign a photo and name for each one. </p><ul><li><p>If you have placeholder assets, this will get tedious especially if you gave that character a lot of dialogue </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Events are simple to use, but if you want to have it on an inanimate object, like a barrel, you need to set the priority to &quot;Same as Characters&quot;. This took longer to figure out than it should've </p></li><li><p>Each sprite needs to be 48x48 or within that range. </p><ul><li><p>You might be able to change that, there was one video that mentioned if you change the overall size of the image then maybe... maybe. </p></li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Friday, April 23, 2021</strong> </p><ul><li><p>Added door 6 from Doon Campus as the game's entrance </p><ul><li><p>This is a popular entrance to the building, we also needed an entrance for narrative purposes so this is what we decided </p></li><li><p>As of this moment, they don't disappear when the player collects the one card or supplies, still need to decide which areas we'll be building for the next week </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Currently, there are three events all around the player that tells them they need to find the one card (this is also where they get money). The same was done for telling them to get the supplies, there is a line of events at the exit of the condor's nest </p><ul><li><p>It is unclear if you can have one event on multiple tiles without copying them </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Need to implement some sort of function that signifies the player completed their objective when they buy supplies </p><ul><li><p>Also need to figure out how they should progress with that, whether that be buying a certain item or spending money </p><ul><li><p>If it's the former, then there's the chance the player won't buy that item and be locked out of continuing </p></li><li><p>If it's the latter, we'll need to find a way of getting that information to the player, we could use the same strategy as telling them to get the one card or supplies and have multiple events </p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>For some reason the tables are weird, the colliders aren't working properly on some of them, the middle pieces specifically </p><ul><li><p>On other middle pieces you can't walk through them, you also can't interact past them. This is why the Condor's Nest NPC interaction happens on both the table and the NPC (in case the player interacts with them from around the corner) </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Add some sort of event the player must interact with to give them money at the start </p><ul><li><p>Giving the player money is as easy as adding a new note in an event, answers online describe having an intro cutscene and giving the player money there </p></li><li><p>We don't have an intro cutscene currently so the player gains money from the first event they must interact with </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Computer crashed and the file became corrupted, based on online research this just seems to be a possibility. I found one other person with the exact issue so it might be an often occurrence or not. </p><ul><li><p>Need to back-up the project every day from now on.  </p></li><li><p>Either you can't transfer a majority of the data folder or we were just unlucky and those were the files that corrupted this time (either way, we'll need to rebuild all the maps and events) </p></li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Monday, April 26, 2021</strong> </p><ul><li><p>We'll be building up the connections between E building and A Building  </p><ul><li><p>Two quests will be intertwined here, the character will decide to head towards the Library to meet with someone from their program </p><ul><li><p>This can easily be extended by having the two decide to go towards their class together for a new quests </p></li><li><p>It could also introduce party mechanics though what those are exactly needs to be decided </p></li></ul></li><li><p>The second quest occurs beforehand as the player meets someone who is too anxious to talk with the person at the service hub </p><ul><li><p>The importance of this quest is not from a mechanic perspective but to help out a fellow student </p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Running out of objects to sprite </p><ul><li><p>Rob finished his early and created a bunch of other assets to fill the time, it's a great problem to have but still an issue </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Backed up a version of the project in case the files get corrupted </p><ul><li><p>If you change the name of an RPG Maker project, you'll need to reimport the game file, it'll still work though </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Rebuilt the Condor's Nest and A Building, they're slightly different, a little smaller but this might be for the best </p></li><li><p>A Building will be split up into maps since it is so large </p></li><li><p>There are conflicting maps available online, not all of them are properly up to date,  C Building specifically had some renovations </p></li><li><p>It is impossible to have a complete Doon Campus experience by just looking at the maps and images we can find, no matter what, what we have is wrong and that's okay </p></li><li><p>Our goal moving forward is to build and prototype other elements that we think could work in the game for future teams </p></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Tuesday, April 27, 2021</strong> </p><ul><li><p>There will be a cutscene that takes place in the library </p></li><li><p>B building and C building are mapped in similar fashion </p><ul><li><p>Similar aesthetics and placement of objects and classrooms </p></li><li><p>The above is specified only because A Building has different spaces allotted for classrooms. </p></li></ul></li><li><p>The CSI section of Building A is changed a bit, with the angle more or less being removed to have the Tim Hortons, CSI room, and Door 3 all visible vertically </p><ul><li><p>RPG Maker doesn't seem to be the greatest at doing angles, it's possible of course with art but the colliders will still be weird. It would also be a pain to create all the assets at that angle </p></li><li><p>Certain elements and halls have slightly different positioning, it was done this way to alleviate the size of the area, there's not point in such empty spaces, even if it's more realistic </p></li></ul></li><li><p>There are six doors near the loading dock, the names of these rooms aren't on maps so they have been unlabeled as of right now. </p></li><li><p>Technical issues made assets difficult to create today  </p></li><li><p>For now we will be continuing with the same wall textures for the hallways, the white one isn't looking great for the purposes of the game </p><ul><li><p>There should be different ones, to differentiate each area more and give more visual variety, but for now it's not a major worry </p></li></ul><p> </p></li></ul><p><strong>Wednesday, April 28, 2021</strong> </p><ul><li><p>Emphasis on new mechanics and cool things we can add with RPG Maker </p><ul><li><p>Implemented four types of cutscenes </p><ul><li><p>Player triggered </p></li><li><p>Automatic </p></li><li><p>Opening cutscene </p></li><li><p>Ending Cutscene </p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Redelegate tasks between people to have a fancier map to show off </p></li><li><p>Made sure events were working, needed to rework how the shop determined whether the quest was completed or not </p></li><li><p>Expanded CSI center a bit </p></li><li><p>Added more doors for classrooms </p></li><li><p>Worked towards having the final assets completed for the final day </p></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Thursday, April 29, 2021</strong> </p><ul><li><p>Finalized the assets meant for Friday's showcase, these assets are the most important to the overall experience </p><ul><li><p>Many assets from RPG Maker have been included, these ones may or may not need to be replaced (teapots and cups are generic enough that they work) </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Many events work properly now with variables and self-switches </p></li><li><p>We had one team member spend the day in a duplicate of the RPG Maker file and place the objects to make the world more interesting. They uploaded it to Teams and each object was slowly put into the main file </p><ul><li><p>We did this because it saved a lot of time on the lead designer and allowed them to just focus on event and dialogue creation, although the process to shift them over is tedious </p></li><li><p>Again, it seems that data cannot be passed from one project to the next </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Sounds have been updated and changed, now they properly transition into each other when necessary </p></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Friday, April 30, 2021</strong> </p><ul><li><p>Edited events for different approaches in different orders </p></li><li><p>Removed certain transitions so the player couldn't softlock themselves </p></li><li><p>Created the easter eggs of great importance </p></li><li><p>Both the project and builds are located in the teams files </p></li><li><p>Added even more dialogue and characters as well as unique events </p></li><li><p>You can have two projects of RPG Maker open at once by opening one through Steam and the other through the exe file located in program files </p></li></ul>
