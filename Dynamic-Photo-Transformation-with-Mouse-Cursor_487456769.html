Russ referred to this as the &ldquo;scratch off lotto ticket&rdquo; type of effect, and he&rsquo;s pretty close in terms of the visual representation!</p><p>Ideally, the mouse cursor could be changed to represent another object, such as a hose, an eraser, a spray nozzle, a rag, etc.  The learner would practice using the tools provided to perform a series of tasks to transform an object through a series of different states.</p><p>The mouse cursor could be enlarged to an appropriate size for the tool in use, and might ideally have less-defined edges, so that it would operate like the spray-paint tool in MSPaint.  For situations where the learner interaction would involve spraying/applying something to the item/equipment in the image, we could ideally add a particle effect that would represent water spraying or air blowing, or whatever.</p><p>&lt;insert sketch to illustrate concept&gt;</p><p /><p /><h2 id="DynamicPhotoTransformationwithMouseCursor-Feedback">Feedback</h2><p>Real-time feedback helps guide the learner to discovery of the correct path.  Feedback should be immediate, clear, and should not rely exclusively on one of the learner&rsquo;s 5 senses to be understood.  For example, if using a sound effect (ding for correct, sad trombone for incorrect), that feedback should be accompanied by a visual effect such as a thumbs-up/thumbs-down or checkmark and X.  Never rely exclusively on colour (green for correct/ red for incorrect) because differently-abled learners may not perceive colours as we do.</p><p>Feedback is more meaningful when it reminds the learner of the rationale - WHY is this method/choice incorrect, how can I tell?</p><h2 id="DynamicPhotoTransformationwithMouseCursor-ExampleUseCases">Example Use Cases</h2><p><strong><span data-colorid="bif2tcy4y9">Step by Step Process</span></strong>:  The learner is presented with an image of a piece of equipment that is dirty.  Using a set of tools such as a water nozzle, a detergent nozzle, a brush, a sanitizer nozzle, etc, the learner could practice dragging the different tools over the item in a specific order to &ldquo;clean&rdquo; the item.  Image could progress from being dirty, then wet and dirty, then soapy, then VERY sudsy (scrub with brush), then wet, then sparkling clean.  This could be achieved by stacking identical images of the equipment in various states, and then using the mouse cursor to erase one layer at a time, based on the tool selected.</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="quym44j8hr">Spot the Difference</span></strong>: The learner is presented with an image of an improperly set up piece of equipment or a badly dressed worker, and they use their mouse cursor to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; all of the areas that do not match the ideal setup or attire.  The image would be updated as they go, so that they can focus on items that they haven&rsquo;t yet identified.</p><p /><h2 id="DynamicPhotoTransformationwithMouseCursor-ImplementationDesigninCOREv1">Implementation Design in COREv1</h2><p>It has been suggested that this effect could be implemented as a custom shader.</p>
