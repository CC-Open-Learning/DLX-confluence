The learner can identify good/bad state just by observing these components as they are presented.  Examples: exterior damage, fluid leaks, windows.</p><p>Atypical inspectables require some kind of evaluation interaction in order for the learner to determine if the component is in a good or bad state.  Examples: checking the oil using a dipstick, checking tire pressure with a mallet, checking if mirrors are securely attached.</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="n4qboegz47">Problem:</span></strong>  In the current inspection system, the learner needs to click to select each item before selecting the appropriate &ldquo;state&rdquo; for that item.  So, if there were 5 windows, but only one of them was cracked, the learner would click on Window #1 on the model and then click to select &ldquo;good&rdquo; in the inspection checklist, then click on Window #2 on the model and then click to select &ldquo;good&rdquo; in the inspection checklist, etc.  This would continue until Window #5, where the learner would click  to select the window on the model and then click &ldquo;cracked&rdquo; in the dropdown menu of the inspection checklist.  This interaction is tedious, and requires the learner to put just as much focus and effort into the &ldquo;good&rdquo; components as they put into the damaged or broken components.</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="npxq6fzsr6">Objective: </span></strong>We wanted to look for a new interaction model that would still require the learner to visually inspect the model, but would reduce the need to interact with the model (fewer clicks) and would provide the opportunity to focus primarily on damages rather than confirming all the undamaged components are good.   We felt it would better represent the real world of vehicle inspections, where the main focus is on scanning for anything that is damaged, and accurately reporting damage that is found.</p><p>We discussed this problem as a team.  Lots of ideas were offered, but after a round-table discussion, two good options emerged.  Both seemed really good, although both had some drawbacks.  These are the two options that we identified:</p><p><strong>Option A - No model interaction, record damage in checklist</strong></p><p>In this option, the learner is required to visually inspect an area of the truck, but <u>does not click on the model</u>.  Following visual inspection, the learner records their results in the checklist by selecting the component name in the inspection checklist (e.g. Brake light), then specifying which one (e.g. L or R), then specifying the damage observed (e.g. cracked or burnt out).</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/453247043/453902388.png" data-image-src="attachments/453247043/453902388.png" data-height="570" data-width="1332" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="453902388" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="Option A - Step 2 (Declined by Russ-Lisa).png" data-base-url="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="453247043" data-linked-resource-container-version="9" data-media-id="e293117a-82bb-463b-b797-eedd87aec1d9" data-media-type="file" /></span><p>There are major advantages to this method:  First off, from a developer perspective, it is remarkably less work to create models that are shown, but not interacted with.  This will not only reduce the dev effort, but will also reduce the memory footprint for the simulation and set us up to uplift the WebGL version of the simulation to headset or room scale later with dramatically less fuss and work.  We could invest less time/resources and make the simulation more accessible for low-memory devices (and perform better overall on all devices) by dramatically reducing the number of model interactions in the user flow.</p><p>The disadvantages of this design are that some of the inspectables will absolutely require that the user interact with them by clicking.  For example, testing the tire pressure with a mallet or removing the oil dipstick.  These steps of the inspection will require the learner to click to interact with the sim, so that there will be a few steps of the inspection that are inconsistent in user interaction, compared to the rest of the inspection which does not allow the user to click on the model.  The team felt that this minor inconsistency could be overcome in the Tutorial, or by using voiceover prompts.</p><p>Another disadvantage this option is that it reduces the interactive engagement of the learner with the simulation. Instead of interacting with the 3D model, the learner almost exclusively interacts with the inspection checklist UI. Some concerns about putting too much focus on the checklist, or how to maintain learner focus on the model.  The team felt that this could be overcome by simplifying the checklist and reducing the number of clicks required to record inspection results (e.g. radio buttons instead of dropdowns, etc.)</p><p><strong>Option B - Click on damaged items only, checklist opens to specify damaged state</strong></p><p>In this option, the learner will visually inspect the component to identify any damaged/bad state, but when they see damage, they click on it to report it.  As soon as the user clicks on the damage, the checklist opens to the selected item (e.g. Brake Light - Left).  The user clicks to select the type of damage (e.g. broken, burnt out) for that specific component.  This is comparable to the inspection interaction used in the HE sim, but with only the damaged components being selected (no need to mark anything as &ldquo;good&rdquo;).</p><p>The images below are the final step in the inspection where the student has already selected the object, and the state.

The learner has the immediate connection of clicking on the damage, and spending less time in the checklist.  Because the learner is accustomed to interacting with the model at each stage of the inspection, it is easy to get them to click for inspection interactions such as hitting the tires with a mallet, removing the oil dipstick, or opening/closing/securing the trailer van doors.</p><p>The disadvantages of this method are that this is not a good representation of the real-life interaction.  When inspecting a truck in real life, the learner does not touch the damaged components, they are simply observed and recorded on the checklist.  On a real checklist, it isn&rsquo;t even necessary to be all that specific, you can just check the &ldquo;Fail&rdquo; column beside Brake Lights and let the mechanic figure it out!  </p><p>The other significant disadvantage of this option is that involves substantially more development effort to make all of the inspection checklist models interactable.  This could extend the development timeline, putting the delivery target at risk.  Further, it would be difficult to maintain in the future compared to the no-touch models, and is particularly complicated to uplift to headset or room scale VR in the future (there is no point-and-click in those interactions).</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="wxml0xqinh">Stakeholders/Experts Consulted</span></strong></p><p><strong>Content Expert, John Way</strong> - <strong><span data-colorid="oz7smz04lm">Not consulted</span></strong>.  This is not a content question and requires no trucking industry experience, this is a software design and pedagogy question.  We left the CE out of it.</p><p><strong>Pedagogy Expert, Lisa Trimble </strong>- <strong><span data-colorid="zxg5im8enn">Consulted</span></strong>.  PI met with Lisa to discuss.  Described both options, including pros and cons for each one.  Lisa was strongly in favour of Option B, pointing out that the tactile experience of clicking on the damage was intentional and meaningful for the learner.  Lisa reminded me that we need to exercise all opportunities to engage our learners in the simulation, even when that means sacrificing some of the gritty reality of the activity.  Passive learning, where there is reduced interactions between the visual learning materials and the student, is associated with weaker learning outcomes and lower learner engagement in the content.  Lisa expressed some concerns about the no-click method in Option A, and that she felt it could lead to less engaged students skipping entire stages of the inspection and just &ldquo;trying their luck&rdquo; since they would still get a successful result if no damages were present (I did explain that we could guarantee that at least 1 reportable damaged component would be present for every stage, but she still felt that reducing student interactions was not a positive influence). Acknowledging the costs (present and future) that may be associated with Option B, Lisa recommended that I check with Russ.  </p><p><strong>ELC e-learning experts - <span data-colorid="rvm4ije65t">Not Consulted</span>.</strong>  Lisa did not feel that consultation with the ELC e-learning experts would be helpful, since she felt that they would always counsel toward increased user interaction with the visual learning materials.</p><p><strong>VARLab Director and Grand Poobah, Russ Foubert </strong>- <strong><span data-colorid="p28o3ri4b0">Consulted</span></strong>.  PI met with Russ to discuss. Same description and pros/cons that were presented to Lisa, but with a bit more elaboration on the costs of Option B compared to Option A.  Discussed the ongoing balancing act of trying to &ldquo;futureproof&rdquo; flat-screen WebGL learning experiences, and how this is affecting our 3rd party partners as well.  Russ was strongly in favour of Option B, in spite of the added costs and effort, and his rationale was identical to Lisa&rsquo;s.  Russ went further into the science behind human learning, talking about neuroplasticity and knowledge acquisition frameworks that can be leveraged to maximize learning potential.  Russ supported the concept of not clicking on &ldquo;good&rdquo; components, but felt that it was 100% human nature for learners to click on the item that they are searching for (the &ldquo;damaged&rdquo; components).  He expressed a prediction that learners might be frustrated if they are unable to click and select the damaged component, in an activity where their primary objective is to &ldquo;identify&rdquo; damages that need to be reported.  He felt that Option A was not as engaging and might be viewed as &ldquo;guessable&rdquo; depending on how the checklist dropdowns were structured.  There was a comment about how terminology might get in the way, if the learner is struggling with identifying specific component names - they know exactly what they are looking at, but might not be able to correctly identify it in a dropdown list of similar-sounding items. Overall, Russ felt strongly that a certain amount of increased cost and re-work is an acceptable price to pay for an optimal present-day learning experience.</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="jp8i3tup4a">FINAL DECISION - Option B.</span></strong></p><hr /><h2 id="DesignConsiderations-COREandTrucking-UserInteractionsfor‘Atypical’Inspectables">User Interactions for &lsquo;Atypical&rsquo; Inspectables</h2><p><strong><span data-colorid="w27s4or9tf">What do we mean by &ldquo;Atypical&rdquo;: </span></strong>In the user inspection workflows, we have two types of inspectables:</p><p>Typical inspectables require visual inspection only.

Examples: checking the oil using a dipstick, checking tire pressure with a mallet, checking if mirrors are securely attached.</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="w6hjl4xtde">Problem:</span></strong>  Our design for the Typical Inspectables in the Trucking sim will train the learner that they should ONLY click on the model when they see something they want to report on their inspection UI.  This is efficient and user friendly, and it allows the learner to focus on finding &amp; reporting damaged/bad states rather than laboriously recording everything that is in good condition.  The problem is that we want all of the user interactions for inspections to be consistent, we have learned that it is crucial to make each step of the inspection process consistent and predictable in terms of what is expected from the learner.  How do we manage inspections that require interactions, when most of the inspectables are purely visual?</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="ic3rh1t2s6">Objective: </span></strong>We wanted to design a way to preserve the user experience while still demonstrating that certain inspectables require an evaluation activity (e.g. pulling the dipstick and wiping it clean before using it to check engine oil level and character).</p><p><strong>Option A: Learner clicks on an icon or button to trigger a cut-scene animation that demonstrates the evaluation interaction</strong></p><p>In this option, the learner will need to do something (e.g. click on a button or icon, we can use a voiceover prompt to make this easy to find) to trigger a fully animated mini cut-scene that shows the evaluation activity taking place. For example, when the learner clicks on the Check Engine Oil button or icon, they will see a cut-scene animation of the oil dipstick being removed, wiped down, returned to original position, and then removed again, with the camera view zooming in on the end of the dipstick so that the learner can observe the oil level and characteristics.  The learner does NOT click on the model to trigger the cut-scene. They might choose to play the cut-scene several times, so that they can practice this evaluation for when they need to do it manually in-person.</p><p>When the cut scene is completed, the learner will have the same two options that they have for any of the &ldquo;typical&rdquo; inspectables, which is to move on to the next inspectable by indicating that they have nothing to report, or to click on the model to open the Inspection UI and report damaged/bad state.</p><p>The advantage here is that the learner decides when they want to see the evaluation activity demonstration, and can easily play the animation as many times as they want.  The disadvantage of this approach is that it requires a UI control (button, icon, toolbar item, etc) for the learner to click on.  Since we do not want them to click on the model unless they see damage, we need a way for them to tell us when they are ready to evaluate .</p><p><strong>Option B: Cut-scene animation shows the evaluation activity automatically when the learner arrives at this inspection POI.</strong></p><p>In this option, everything works like it does in Option A, but there is no click required to trigger the cut-scene to play - it plays automatically when the learner arrives at the inspection POI.  This option saves the user having to click to start the animation, so it is more efficient and user-friendly.  However, it might be awkward when the learner wants to replay the cut-scene multiple times.</p><p /><p />
