Knowing how long a student took to complete a inspection could be very helpful in identifying areas where a student needs review or needs to build confidence.</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="o57em1aia9"><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="5c43b3d6-9d27-4862-a464-aa7af8cd010e">Proposed Solution: </span></span></strong><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="5c43b3d6-9d27-4862-a464-aa7af8cd010e">Inspection Timer - The CE is strongly in favour of having an inspection timer in the DLX, but we don&rsquo;t want it to take too much attention or distract the learner.  For this reason, we will consider a design that is visible but not attention-catching, and possibly can be hidden so that users who don&rsquo;t want to monitor their efficiency can avoid distraction.  Some other inspection timer requirements:</span></p><ul><li><p>timer must not begin running until the inspection starts, immediately after the player completes the 2 pre-requisite tasks. &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>timer counts UP not down, to avoid having the player think it is a time limit</p></li><li><p>Format of timer is hh:mm:ss such as 00:00:01</p></li><li><p>must be possible for the player to manually pause the game (e.g. bathroom break). &nbsp;The player cannot engage in any task, menu item, or navigation while the game is paused, until they resume playing and the timer resumes. The scene should be covered up while the game is paused (big dialog that says PAUSED with a button &ldquo;Resume&rdquo;)</p></li><li><p>timer must auto-pause and auto-resume at the start and end of any in-game tutorial segments that occur while the player is in the inspection process (timer stops running during the tutorial).</p></li><li><p>timer must be saved as part of cloud save, so that a student returning after a few days can resume the inspection from where they left off without losing their elapsed time so far</p></li></ul><p><strong><span data-colorid="qaygjv3ejp">Problem: </span></strong>Students will use the left mouse button to navigate as well as for inspection interactions (selecting tools, selecting items to inspect, selecting decision buttons).  This can cause conflicts because we won&rsquo;t be sure if the user wants to move or interact with something.</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="z8c6n5sawd">Proposed Solution:</span></strong>  Create functional barriers between the navigation actions and the inspection actions by limiting what the user can do based on their current location.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><strong>Navigation mode:</strong> Users will navigate by clicking on visible navigation targets (one per POI) that are on the floor of the facility.  From any POI, the student can navigate by clicking on another POI target that is within their field of view.  Note that players cannot navigate directly to any POI that they cannot currently see. They can select a POI that is within view and then immediately navigate to another POI that is within view from that position, etc.  Note every navigation target is a POI, some targets are just a way of moving from place to place, but have no inspection tasks.  All POI&rsquo;s have a navigation target.  Users enter a POI by selecting that navigation target.  The CE rejected navigation options such as a menu of possible locations or a top-down map that would allow the student to move quickly from one end of the restaurant to the other.  The CE does not want anything that will give the student an advantage (list of locations, map of the premises) that they would never have in real life.</p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>To prevent motion sickness related to free-roaming camera navigation, we will provide protective strategies for the camera controller:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>While in navigation mode, the camera will automatically pan to the selected navigation target, so that the camera is <strong>always looking in the direction of travel</strong>. It is not possible for the user to manually pan the camera while traveling from one POI to another.</p></li><li><p>While stationary, the user can pan the camera up, down, left, or right by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen in the direction they want to look.  Camera pan motion will be <strong>carefully speed controlled</strong> to prevent sudden disorienting camera movements.</p></li><li><p>Pan can only occur in <strong>ONE direction at a time</strong> (never on a diagonal) to prevent multiple planes of motion occuring simultaneously.</p></li><li><p>Up &amp; down pan will be limited to normal anatomical boundaries when looking up or down to prevent &ldquo;backflip&rdquo; effects.</p></li><li><p>User cannot pan more than 360 degrees to the left or right, to avoid spinning like a top.</p></li></ol></div></div><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><strong>Inspection mode:</strong> When a user enters an inspection POI (ie. clicks on a navigation target that has one or more inspection tasks associated with it), the inspectable elements in that POI will become interactable (colliders enabled).  Interactable items will highlight on mouseover, and will remain highlighted when selected.  Every POI should include at least one item that is interactable, but is irrelevant to the inspection workflow.  Only the interactable items at the current POI will be enabled, all others  (even if they are visible from the current POI) will remain disabled.  This will require some careful planning about where to place navigation targets for different POI&rsquo;s that are located close together so that there is a logical division between POI&rsquo;s.</p><p> </p><p><strong><span data-colorid="bi3xay7gpu">Problem:</span> </strong>There are a lot of sinks in the restaurant, so we might have a hard time knowing if the student has forgotten to wash their hands.  What if the handwashing station that they select is in bad condition (missing paper towels or no running water)?  Reporting a problem with a handwashing station would technically be an inspection action, but they are not allowed to start the inspection before washing their hands, so this is a paradox!</p><p><strong><span data-colorid="s4q88cq6k8">Proposed Solution: </span></strong>Checked with the CE Ken Diplock and he responded that the inspector should wash their hands anywhere EXCEPT in the bathrooms.  There is no particular time limit for them to wash their hands, as long as they do it before they inspect anything.  In our DLX, this means that the student can walk all around the game in navigation mode, and that&rsquo;s fine as long as they don&rsquo;t inspect anything (inspecting would mean selecting a tool + interactable object).  If they select ONLY a tool or ONLY an interactable object, that is not an inspection, unless they select both (in any order).  There should be hand sinks in the bar area (right beside reception, we will just have to remove a wall or lower it to a half-wall), and at all main entrances to the food prep area.   To avoid the paradox mentioned above, Ken suggested that ALL handwashing stations must be in good condition in the DLX.  We will remind the student of what to look for at a handwashing station by including this information in the confirmation message that pops up after they select that POI. Something like &ldquo;You have washed your hands. This hand sink is in good condition, with hot and cold running water, liquid soap, and paper towels.&rdquo;</p><p /><h2 id="DesignAdaptationNotes-Temporarypage-UserProgressandFeedback">User Progress and Feedback</h2><p>Problem:  The user needs some kind of progress indicator so that they can tell how they are progressing in the DLX, but most of our ideas (checklist, heat map) have been rejected by the CE because they provide too many clues to the student.  Our goal is for this user experience to be very exploratory and unguided, but it isn&rsquo;t user-friendly to provide NO context to the user about their progress.  We found a good compromise that we think will meet everyone&rsquo;s needs, and Ken loves it.</p><p>Proposed Solution:  We will allow the user to have unlimited access to their progress so far, and we will give them quantifiable feedback about how they are doing, without providing any correction or direction while the inspection is in progress.</p><h3 id="DesignAdaptationNotes-Temporarypage-IN-GAMEPROGRESSINDICATORS:">IN-GAME PROGRESS INDICATORS:</h3><p><strong>Activity Log</strong> - All navigation and task actions will be recorded in the Activity Log. &nbsp;The Activity Log is available to be viewed by the user at all times during the game, and is also included in the final Results (Ken requested this, but I&rsquo;m not sure he will like it when he sees how verbose the log is). &nbsp;The main objective of the activity log is for the user to be able to <strong>see what they have done so far in this playthrough</strong>. &nbsp;No info about previous playthroughs will be included. &nbsp;We need to consider how to present the info because this log will become very verbose. &nbsp;</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Every time a player enters or exits a POI, we record that in the Activity Log (suggestion to include in-game timer for each line of the Activity Log, sounds good, but we also have to include pre-timer events such as Washed hands and Introduction and showed ID. &nbsp;Those items won't have a timestamp, or can just be marked as 0:00:00.</p></li><li><p>Every action the player takes will specify the POI - action - object - (measurement), and then a separate event for their decision, for example:&nbsp;<br />00:04:21 Walk-In Cooler - Probe Thermometer - Raw chicken - 51C<br />00:04:28 NON-COMPLIANCE RECORDED Walk-In Cooler - Raw chicken<br />0:11:46 Pantry - Camera - Floor - photo taken<br />0:11:46 Compliant - Pantry - Floor</p></li><li><p>The Activity Log cannot be edited. It is a record of every POI that the student visited and every action &amp; decision that they made&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The Activity Log will not record items that are visible or selected by left mouse click, unless the user performs an action (selects a tool). This will prevent accidental clicks from polluting the log.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Non-Compliance Log </strong>- This is a list of all non-compliances that the student has recorded (valid or invalid) so far in the game. &nbsp;This list is editable! &nbsp;If the student reported a problem and they later change their mind (or they reported it by accident) they can delete items from this list. &nbsp;Deleting the report will not change the original activity log entry, but will add a Non-Compliance Deleted (specify POI - item - tool) event to the Activity Log to show that they deleted that non-compliance.</p><p><strong>Evaluate</strong> - This is a way for the student to check on their progress without getting too much direction about what they might have missed. &nbsp;They will get somewhat vague progress-style results such as:</p><ul><li><p>You have visited 18 out of 23 inspection locations at this facility</p></li><li><p>You have reported 7 out of 11 non-compliances that are present at this facility.</p></li><li><p>You have reported 2 invalid non-compliances.</p></li></ul><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>Notice that we aren't telling them exactly WHICH locations they have not visited, or WHERE the non-compliances are that they might have missed. &nbsp;The idea is to guide them about the completion status of their inspection, without telling them where to go or what to do.</p></div></div><p /><h3 id="DesignAdaptationNotes-Temporarypage-ENDOFSIMULATION-FINALRESULTS">END OF SIMULATION - FINAL RESULTS</h3><p><strong>Submit</strong> - This is the final step that ends the simulation. &nbsp;When the player clicks Submit, we need to warn them that they will be unable to continue this inspection after they submit the report, but they can return for a brand new inspection as many times as they want. The Final Report is what we will store in eConestoga, and it will also be displayed on screen for immediate review. It will be used by the student, to review their results and maybe to help them complete their Hedgehog report. It will also be used by the instructor, to review how the inspection went and what the student missed. &nbsp;It will include the information:&nbsp;</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Scenario number - this is meaningful to the instructor, means nothing to the student</p></li><li><p>List of ALL inspection locations (POIs) in this scenario with an indicator of any that were missed (student did not perform any actions that location)</p></li><li><p>All inspection tasks they performed (grouped by POI) that were missed (no action seleted), incorrect (wrong conclusion), or invalid (wrong tool action). </p></li><li><p>List of non-compliances that were recorded </p><ol start="1"><li><p>Correct - used the correct tool, correct item, and decision was correct</p></li><li><p>Missed - non-compliant items that were not inspected or were incorrectly judged to be Compliant when they were non-compliant</p></li><li><p>Invalid - used incorrect tool, or selected incorrect item, or reported something Compliant as if it was non-compliant </p></li></ol></li></ol>
