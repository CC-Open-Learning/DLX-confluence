Further discussion revealed that it is possible students might also want to reset their progress in the Orientation segment, so there is no good reason to restrict this feature to instructors only (we did make it clear that it is possible to have different behaviour for instructors compared to students, but CEs did not feel this would be beneficial). </p></li><li><p><strong>DECISION</strong>:  Use the existing Save &amp; Load dialog in Orientation to make it consistent with all of the procedural segments.  We are already saving &amp; loading progress for Orientation, the only change will be to offer users that have a save file the option to Continue or Start from Beginning.  This will provide consistency for students and instructors across all segments of the DLX and will not require any new UI design.  Everyone likes the existing design and it has been used successfully in many other products, this is the best choice. </p></li></ul></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>

In the current tech design, the only way for the student to exit the vitals view is to select &ldquo;Proceed&rdquo; to continue the procedure.  The whole time they are reviewing the vitals monitor (or while the procedure is paused and the recovery animation is playing to restore the vitals to normal), they can&rsquo;t participate in other tasks.  Could we add a prompt for them to auscultate right after the procedure is resumed?  CE&rsquo;s say yes, that would be great.</p></li><li><p>Discussed the need to have a clear difference between Normal and Critical vitals.  If the bad state is too close to the good state (e.g. just a few bpm difference in the HR or a couple of percentage points on the O2 sats) then the recovery animation will be almost impossible to see.  If we want to demonstrate the patient being in distress and then recovering when the procedure is paused, we need to make sure that the difference between normal and not-normal is big enough to see clearly.

If the RT chooses to Proceed in that case, they get immediate feedback from the Physician NPC. &nbsp;While paused, the vitals should improve and then the procedure will continue from where we left off.</p><p>Ideally the vitals will change &ldquo;randomly&rdquo; throughout the procedure and the RT will need to respond to the situation.  If the vitals are very bad and the RT student is not checking the vitals, we can have an audio/visual alarm prompt so that they know they need to look at the Vitals.</p><p>Vitals monitor will be present in the scene at all times, but the student needs to click on the monitor or on the Vitals button in the main toolbar to see the animation and &ldquo;check&rdquo; the vitals.

NOTE that values shown here are suggestions only and must be confirmed with CEs before going into the requirements - this is just an example of ranges that could be shown for each state:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Stable:</strong> &nbsp;All values are in range e.g. SpO2 at/above 96, HR between 62-76, BP between 118/72 - 126/88.&nbsp; In this state, the correct answer is Proceed.<br />NOTE: ALL PATIENTS must start the procedure with Vitals Stable, this is a requirement to begin the procedure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mild Distress:</strong> &nbsp;SpO2 between 91-94, HR between 80-88, BP between 130/90 - 148/98.  In this state, the student can choose to Proceed or Pause.</p></li><li><p><strong>Critical:</strong> SpO2 between 85-90, elevated HR between 94-120, elevated BP between 156/104 - 166/116.  In this state, the correct answer is Pause.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recovery:&nbsp;</strong> This animation will show a gradual (10-20 seconds) recovery period where patient vitals improve from Critical -&gt; Stable or from Mild Distress -&gt; Stable. This animation will only play when the Pause option is selected.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Student can click to check patient vitals anytime they want.  Each time they click, we will randomly show Stable/Mild Distress/ Critical animation.</p></li><li><p>If the student doesn&rsquo;t click to view vitals, a new animation can be selected every X minutes.</p></li><li><p>Every time the student clicks to view the patient vitals, they will have the opportunity to <strong>Report </strong>specific values on the screen - this will result in hearing a recording of the value being read out, e.g. &quot;Heart rate is at 90&quot;. Reporting is optional, and can be done for any of the values, regardless if they are in range or not. &nbsp;The physician NPC will respond to all reports - specific responses can be mapped later. &nbsp;Clicking the Report option does not exit the Vitals view.</p></li><li><p>Every time the student clicks to view patient vitals, they must make a decision to <strong>Proceed or Pause</strong> the procedure. &nbsp;This is the only way to exit the vitals view and return to the procedure. This decision can be made with or without Reporting any values. &nbsp;Vitals will remain in the current pattern (looping) until the student makes a decision about whether to continue or pause the procedure (taking a very long time to decide does not count as &quot;Pause&quot; - they must actually select the Pause option)</p><ul><li><p><strong>Proceed:</strong> Continue with the procedure without pausing - this exits the Vitals view. &nbsp;If the student selects this option when patient vitals are Mild Distress, no feedback is given, but this could result in patient deterioration (either an alarm prompt or patient vitals are degraded to Critical on next Vitals view). If the student selects this option when the patient vitals are Critical, they will get immediate feedback from the physician NPC.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pause:</strong> Temporarily halt the procedure - this does not exit the Vitals view. &nbsp;When this option is selected, the student will hear a recording of the recommendation to pause the procedure - this is separate from the Report of a specific value from the monitor. &nbsp; The physician will respond to all Pause recommendations.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>If the student selects this option when patient vitals are stable, they will get immediate feedback from the physician NPC. e.g. &ldquo;I think everything looks good, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to stop right now.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>If the student selects this option when patient vitals are Mild Distress or Critical, they will get confirmation from the physician NPC and the Recovery animation will start to play. &nbsp;Note that the <strong>Patient NPC appearance does not change when the vitals state changes</strong>.  Only the Vitals monitor animation is variable. At any point during the Recovery animation, the student can select Proceed (the Pause option is disabled while the procedure is Paused), but if the patient vitals have not recovered to an acceptable range, they will get immediate feedback from the Physician NPC. &nbsp;Once the patient vitals have returned to acceptable range (tbd by CE&rsquo;s), the student can select Proceed to exit the Vitals view.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="CEPlayableDemoFeedbackTracking-RT-05DEC2024-MeetingCancelledduetoCEavailability">05 DEC 2024 - Meeting Cancelled due to CE availability</h2><h2 id="CEPlayableDemoFeedbackTracking-RT-28NOV2024-CEfeedbackfrom:GinoDePinto,KarlWeiss">28 NOV 2024 - CE feedback from: Gino De Pinto, Karl Weiss</h2><p>This week, the meeting focused on demo build <a class="external-link" href="https://stuconestogacon.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/VARLab/EfQL65j6rChLsrcxOTy0MvsBEj8hIQMTwwz8Jz421zzt3A?e=uEfiCc" rel="nofollow">RT-24F6.0-21NOV2024.zip</a> and we also discussed <a data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AQCbSQ" rel="nofollow">https://varlab-dev.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AQCbSQ</a> and plans for the Procedural segment scenes.</p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-table-width="950" data-layout="default" data-local-id="9ed97da8-5bd4-4451-be1d-808557c2f6cf" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 517.0px;" /><col style="width: 432.0px;" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><th data-highlight-colour="#b3d4ff" class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Stakeholder Feedback</strong></p></th><th data-highlight-colour="#b3d4ff" class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Jira Ticket Number(s)</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong><span data-colorid="u16464k0vk">General feedback</span></strong></p><ul><li><p>Looks fantastic - only a few minor adjustments requested</p></li><li><p>Gino will send<strong> RT program logo</strong> for welcome screen (received - in SharePoint)</p></li><li><p>Kris Lee avatar is awesome!&nbsp;Gino liked the cartoon guy, but we explained that some students prefer a more professional look.
