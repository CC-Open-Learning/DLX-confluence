Beyond this point, it would be necessary to put much more effort into turning the wheel, and the steer tires would turn to the right or left when you do so.</p><p>Excessive play: Steering wheel can be easily moved to the right or the left a LARGER distance, such as 20cm or approx 1/4 of the total circumference. Note that the movement of the steering wheel is easy, does not require much effort to turn, and the steer tires of the truck DO NOT MOVE when the steering wheel moves. This condition is called excessive “play” and indicates a potentially serious maintenance issue in the steering linkages.</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#f4f5f7" class="confluenceTd"><p>Excessive “play” in the steering wheel is caused by mechanical failure or maintenance issue in the steering mechanisms attaching the steering wheel to the steer tires of the cab.  The learner does not need to identify the exact problem, but they need to identify if there is too much “play” in the wheel, which is evidenced by how far you can easily turn the wheel without turning the tires.</p><p>It is understood that the learner cannot see the steer tires from the cab interior, so we may need to tinker with the exact right way to show this problem.  The fact is that you don’t need to actually see the tires to determine if they are turning, because turning the tires while the truck is parked requires quite a lot of effort.  We can focus on how far the wheel can be turned EASILY without any resistance, and that will likely be sufficient vs actually getting out to look at the steer tires.</p></td></tr><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#f4f5f7" class="confluenceTd"><p>

These are two large push/pull buttons on the dashboard, red and yellow plastic (see reference photos for specific appearance). Brakes are activated when the button is pulled fully out from the dashboard. The student must NOT release and reapply the parking brakes to inspect them. They simply verify that the buttons are pulled all the way out as far as they can go.</p><p>This is <strong>not an inspection</strong>, but we will use a physical inspection button to trigger the animation. Checking the parking brakes is a required step to proceed with the inspection. The learner will follow the prompts to verify the brakes are activated (or will activate them if they were not applied) and then click “Next Inspection” to continue to the next inspectable or next POI.</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#f4f5f7" class="confluenceTd"><p>User clicks on the physical inspection button to trigger an animation where a hand/glove pulls each one of the buttons (Parking Brake and Trailer Air Supply) buttons outward, away from the dashboard.</p><p>As a tactile “inspection” step, a toast message will be shown at the top of the screen to tell the user how the buttons “feel”.</p><p>If the user clicks on the model, there will be no Inspection panel with bad states to select.  This is not an inspection.</p><p> </p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#f4f5f7" class="confluenceTd"><p>Very rarely, the truck or trailer parking brake will not be activated, the truck was left in an unsafe condition.</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#f4f5f7" class="confluenceTd"><p>This is not an inspection - the parking brakes will ALWAYS work and there will be no Inspection Checklist.  This is because a failure of the parking brake would mean that it would be unsafe to complete the exterior inspection, and we don’t want that to happen in our sim.</p><p>Instead, we will show two possibilities to help illustrate to the student how essential it is to always manually check that the parking brakes are securely applied:</p><p>Good: Animated hand/glove pulls each of the two buttons outward from the dashboard. The buttons do not move. Toast message indicates that the brakes are securely applied.</p><p>Bad: Animated hand/glove pulls each of the two buttons outward from the dashboard. One or both buttons show that they are being pulled outward. Toast message indicates that the brakes were NOT fully applied, and assure that the brakes are now secured.</p></td><td data-highlight-colour="#f4f5f7" class="confluenceTd"><p>The student MUST verify that the parking brakes are applied before conducting the exterior inspection, particularly the wheel inspections. This inspection must be done MANUALLY, a visual inspection is NOT ADEQUATE. <strong> If the parking brake(s) are not applied for either the truck or the trailer, the student must ensure they are applied before proceeding with the inspection.</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#f4f5f7" class="confluenceTd"><p>

When the key is turned to the “ON” position, gauges will “sweep” and some gauges will give a valid reading (e.g. fuel gauge) even without the engine running. It is not actually universal for gauges to “sweep” some will just show a reading right away, but John prefers for us to show gauges that sweep so that students can recognize that as a way of checking that gauges are functional.</p><p>Key turned halfway: All analogue gauges “sweep” and return to zero. Voltmeter shows 12-12.8V.<br/><br/>Engine started: Gauges do NOT sweep again.</p><p>Fuel and DEF gauges rise quickly to their correct value and then don’t move.</p><p>Air pressure and oil pressure gauges rise SLOWLY to their correct value. NOTE that air pressure and oil pressure gauges will take between 30-60 seconds to give a proper reading - this is why we don’t have the student read them immediately after starting the engine!<br/><br/>Speedometer stays as 0 for the entire sim, because the truck does not move.<br/><br/>Tachometer is at 0 until the engine is started, then it reads somewhere around 900-1200RPM steady for the rest of the sim.</p><p>Voltmeter goes from 12.XV up to 14.4V when the engine is started.</p><p>See the video Inspection 15 around 2min in for great close-up footage of the dashboard when the gauges are initialized. You will see the warning lights all come on at once and notice that those gauges do not actually do a full sweep (but you get a good idea of the movement of the needle and imagine a gauge that would do a full sweep before giving a reading)</p></td></tr><tr><td data-highlight-colour="#f4f5f7" class="confluenceTd"><p>
