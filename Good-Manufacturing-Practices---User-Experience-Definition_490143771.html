                    <p>In this page, we will work toward a description of the learner experience when playing the DLS.</p><p>Please note that the learning content and user experience will be identical for the branded and generic modules - the only difference will be that custom “VG Meats” branded media or text will be used for the branded module.  This page describes the user experience for both branded and generic modules.</p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-warning confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>On Sept 7 2022, there was a meeting between Stacey, Lisa, Nicole, and Ping Wu (OMAFRA contact) to refine and focus the scope of the GMP module.  The concern from VARLab was that the volume of content planned for the GMP module was far too broad for the timeline and resources available. The original plan for the module was to cover: Introduction to GMP’s and why they are important, Personal practices incl hygiene, dress code, PPE, workplace behaviours, and Facility practices incl storage, scheduling, allergens, documentation practices.<br/><br/>At the end of this meeting, we had decided to <strong>focus specifically on the Personal Practices </strong>that employees are responsible for. Rather than giving a general training on GMP’s at the concept level, we decided that employees would benefit most from learning their personal responsibilities.  The backbone of this module will be this training video from OMAFRA: <a class="external-link" href="https://stuconestogacon.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/VARLab/EXI-rqmwI9dDif-wwTUyri4BRITWKmvPMt_JZvqo5YfZqQ?e=5fRA6Z" rel="nofollow">OMAFRA Training video.VOB</a></p><p>We will focus on uplifting the training video by breaking it up into shorter, focused clips that concentrate on personal practices such as: </p><ul><li><p>Stay home when you’re sick</p></li><li><p>Shower frequently, wash hair, wear clean clothes</p></li><li><p>Wash hands properly and frequently</p></li><li><p>Don’t shake hands or touch contaminated surfaces like door handles</p></li><li><p>No food or drink except in designated areas, includes gum, cough drops, water</p></li><li><p>No artificial nails or eyelashes</p></li><li><p>Store PPE properly - wear fresh clean PPE every time</p></li><li><p>No personal items in the food processing areas, incl purse, phone, jewelry, medications</p></li></ul></div></div><p>Uplift Traditional Training Using XR Learning</p><p>This research project is centred around the concept of exploring whether or not (or to what extent) learning outcomes can be enhanced through the use of interactive XR training, compared to traditional training modalities such as PowerPoint presentations and instructional videos.  Our GMP training module will be designed to make that comparison as straightforward as possible, by using the OMAFRA training video (circa 2006) that is currently used to train employees.</p><p>A control group will be trained on Personnel Practices of GMPs using only the instructional video. This is a passive learning experience, which does not support learner interactions or any opportunity to apply what has been learned.</p><p>One or more test groups will be trained on the same topics using our GMP digital learning simulation.  This is a learner-driven experience that will follow our EXPLAIN-SHOW-DO design concept, offering learners the opportunity to learn at their own pace, and apply their knowledge as they go.</p><p>After training is completed, learning outcomes will be measured by the research team.  Success will be measured according to employee compliance with facility/industry SOPs, as well as demonstrated understanding of how to apply learning objectives in the workplace.  For richer metrics, the research team might choose to take measurements at different time intervals, such as immediately following training, 1 month after training, 6 months after training, etc.  It is our expectation that the interactive XR training will result in clearly superior learning outcomes, both immediately after training and for the long term.</p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-tip"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-approve confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>All of these learning objectives will be satisfied using clips and examples from the training video <a class="external-link" href="https://stuconestogacon.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/VARLab/EXI-rqmwI9dDif-wwTUyri4BRITWKmvPMt_JZvqo5YfZqQ?e=5fRA6Z" rel="nofollow">OMAFRA Training video.VOB</a>  To make the video clips as effective as possible, we can use info panels, arrows, text overlay, voiceover, sound effects, etc. to focus on the specific learning objectives that we want to cover.</p></div></div><h3 id="GoodManufacturingPractices-UserExperienceDefinition-SEGMENT1-IntroductiontoGMP’s">SEGMENT 1 - Introduction to GMP’s</h3><p>The user needs a VERY BRIEF overview to set the context for Personnel Practices. </p><ul><li><p>What are GMPs? - Good Manufacturing Practices are daily guidelines and activities that EVERYONE must participate in to protect food safety and employee safety in the workplace.</p></li><li><p>What are contamination hazards (with examples of each type of contamination)?  </p><ul><li><p><strong>Bacterial contamination</strong> happens when bacteria that cause illness get into food products.<br/>EXAMPLES: raw food coming in contact with ready-to-eat food, employees coming to work when they are unwell.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chemical contamination</strong> happens when substances that do not belong in food product are accidentally included. EXAMPLES: Allergens such as nuts, dairy, or soy get into products that should not have these ingredients, Cleaning agents get into food products.</p></li><li><p><strong>Physical contamination</strong> happens when inedible objects or foreign materials get into food products by accident. EXAMPLES: Hair in food, bits of broken machinery or packaging in food.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>How do these <strong>hazards impact food safety</strong> and employee workplace safety?  When food product become contaminated, consumers can become seriously ill. Product must not be sold and a widespread food recall can destroy the reputation or brand loyalty of customers. When employees come in contact with contaminants, they can become ill or injured. The food processing facility can be shut down, costing jobs.</p></li><li><p>What can employees PERSONALLY do to help <strong>reduce contamination hazards</strong>?  The daily practices of reducing hazards are part of Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMPs.  GMP’s are followed at every level of food processing and at every step of the process.  Employees need to know and follow these practices.</p></li></ul><p>KNOWLEDGE CHECK: Learner must confirm that they understand what GMP’s are and why they are so important. They must correctly answer the knowledge check question before they can move on to the next segment.</p><h3 id="GoodManufacturingPractices-UserExperienceDefinition-SEGMENT2-PersonnelPractices:"><strong>SEGMENT 2 - Personnel Practices</strong>:  </h3><ul><li><p><strong>Dress code</strong> - wearing clean, appropriate clothing in the workplace is one important way that we protect food safety.  It is every employee’s responsibility to KNOW the dress code that is applicable to their role, and to FOLLOW that dress code.</p></li><li><p><strong>PPE</strong> - Personal Protective Equipment must be worn correctly to be effective.  Use fresh, clean PPE every time, and ensure that PPE is stored correctly. KNOW exactly which PPE is required for your role, and how to properly store, apply, remove, and dispose of used PPE. Note that we will not provide specifics about every role and what PPE they require for every task, but we will emphasize how important it is to follow facility SOP very carefully.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hygiene</strong> - showering before coming to work, keeping hair neatly tied back, leaving jewelry at home, keeping fingernails and facial hair clean and well trimmed.  No cosmetics such as artificial fingernails or eyelashes are permitted in the food processing areas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Healthy Safe Workplace</strong> - never come to work when you are feeling unwell or if you have skin a skin condition (lesions or rashes). Contact your supervisor for further instructions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Workplace Behaviours</strong> - activities like shaking hands, spitting of any kind, biting nails, are all hazardous.  Never bring personal items into the food processing areas (purse, phone, headphones). Never eat or drink anything in the food processing areas (this includes gum, cough drops, water, coffee). </p></li></ul><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-warning confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><ul><li><p>There is a separate module about Handwashing, so we won’t go in-depth on that aspect of Hygiene (just a reminder that frequent, proper handwashing is an essential part of keeping employees and food products safe)</p></li></ul></div></div><hr/><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p><strong>Beyond Segment 2, the content of this module is completely optional.</strong>  If the development team has time, they MAY choose to implement a drag and drop minigame to help the learner practice what they have learned about how personnel practices can control/prevent food safety hazards.

These could be photos, symbols, and may include text captions to help clarify each choice.  The learner will be prompted to select an “answer” and drop it onto the hazard image.</p><p>When the user drags and drops the correct GMP practice(s) - in this case, either the hairnet or the beard net - over the “hazard” photo, they will get positive feedback (e.g. success sound effects such as ding-ding, green thumbs-up symbol displayed briefly on screen).</p><p>If the learner selects an incorrect GMP practice - in this case, the floor cleaner, the work boot, or the jewelry - the photo will not successfully “drop” onto the hazard photo in the top panel.
