Instead of a puddle or dripping liquid, a diesel leak leaves a dark greasy stain behind, which is very sticky.

The result is a well-defined patch of thick, furry-looking black-brown dirt stuck to the tank in the area of the leak.

There is no reason to record dirty windows as part of the pre-trip inspection, even though it frequently occurs that the entire outside of the truck (including exterior lights, reflectors, or license plate) could get dirty in the normal course of operating the truck. The operator sometimes just wipes these clean with a rag or will take a few minutes to get the truck washed when his schedule permits.
