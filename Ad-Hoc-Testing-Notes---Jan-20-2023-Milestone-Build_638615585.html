                    <p>XPertVR provided an interim milestone build for the SAR 2.0 project on Jan 20, 2023.  This build was installed in the VARDeck (2C08) for demo purposes, and has been used for informal testing purposes throughout February.  These notes are a compilation of my notes from my own testing, and from observations made during classroom use of SAR 2.0 on Feb 15, 2023 with Casey Cooper‚Äôs semester 2 students (in their 6th session in the VARDeck)</p><p>I won‚Äôt try to assign any kind of priority to these issues - many of them are likely a direct result of partially implemented features that are par for the course in an interim build. Still, it‚Äôs nice to have a record of the test experience, however informal, so that we can compare later results and observe progress.</p><p>I‚Äôve divided these up into broad chunks just to help myself stay organized and maybe to help future demos of the Jan20 build to avoid pitfalls. </p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon"></span><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>All testing was done using House #2 because students are pretty sick of House #1 <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" data-emoji-id="1f642" data-emoji-shortname=":slight_smile:" data-emoji-fallback="üôÇ" src="images/icons/emoticons/smile.png" width="16" height="16" data-emoticon-name="smile" alt="(smile)"/>  All testing was done with Cosmos VIVE headset.  Test setup included one Command station and two Student stations.  There were always two players and one command, never more or less. We did not use the Tutorial.</p></div></div><h2 id="AdHocTestingNotes-Jan202023MilestoneBuild-Tools">Tools</h2><ul><li><p>Flashlight is sometimes very difficult to turn on (takes multiple attempts) and then randomly turns itself off while in use (just turn it on again, it still works)</p></li><li><p>Flashlight may disappear from your hand while in use. (just get it from the tool belt again, still works)</p></li><li><p>Flashlight should be clipped to jacket, not handheld.</p></li><li><p>Grab halligan with 2 hands, upper hand may appear to be upside down. Still works fine.</p></li><li><p>Grab halligan with 2 hands, then release trigger with upper hand. Hand gets stuck to the tool (you can wave it around, it is no longer attached to your body). Now release the halligan completely, that hand is gone (not visible on screen) and you have to do the rest of the scenario with only one hand (still possible to play normally, but you only have one hand)</p></li><li><p>PASS display does not update for about 5-10 seconds after you pick it up. You‚Äôve been in the house for ~5 minutes and you check it, says 4500. Hold it for about 10 seconds and wait, it will suddenly update to 2200.</p></li><li><p>PASS analog and digital gauges do not match. We saw some very serious differences of 300-500 PSI</p></li><li><p>Instructors noted that air seems to be used up too quickly in 2.0 sim, although this might be because students are doing an exterior 360 and they are ‚Äúon air‚Äù the whole time! Students should have to manually go ‚Äúon air‚Äù when they enter the hot zone and not use up all their air while walking around the exterior of the structure. IRL firefighters are required to report to Accountability when they are entering ‚Äúon air‚Äù or exiting the hot zone ‚Äúoff air‚Äù so it would be good for students to have to do this in game. If not the communications task then at least a manual toggle to go on &amp; off air as needed.  This would probably not be such a big deal if we had the ability to change the cylinders (rehab).</p></li><li><p>Very difficult to keep ahold of victims when extracting/dragging, especially on the stairs.  Have to repeatedly stop and go back to get the victim, not sure what the problem is. Hand stays closed the whole time, but victim frequently detaches from grip.</p></li><li><p>There were definitely some comments in class about how realistic it is to drag a victim up or down stairs, particularly when the victim is moving around (responsive/awake?)</p></li></ul><p /><h2 id="AdHocTestingNotes-Jan202023MilestoneBuild-Map/Navigation">Map/Navigation</h2><ul><li><p>Fall through front porch into basement bathroom - happened twice with different groups but I did not see it either time (only saw that they were in the basement bathroom with the door closed - they told me they fell through the porch.</p></li><li><p>Got stuck on alpha bravo corner of house when rounding corner to do the 360 assessment. Was eventually able to get out by crawling backwards, but had used most of my air by then.</p></li><li><p>Difficult to navigate down the delta side of House #2 for 360, players had to crawl (teleport not working)</p></li><li><p>Alpha side forcible entry, door does not open normally (looks like sliding glass door opening, but it is a hinge door). Works okay, just looks weird.</p></li><li><p>Try to open sliding glass door on charlie side to outdoor deck, the entire charlie wall slid left and right (instead of just the door). Tried several times, crashed the game (just me, partner was still in)</p></li><li><p>Got stuck in charlie wall near delta corner, past the sliding glass door.  Visible on both sides of the wall, could not get out.</p></li><li><p>Sank into the main floor living room near the seat of the fire in Scenario 1, could not move, stuck in the floor up to about mid-thigh level. </p></li><li><p>Got stuck in stone walkway/stairs on delta side when trying to go from backyard to front. Partner player sees me stuck in the ground up to the waist.  I could not go forward or get out, even crawling. Air ran out and I died.</p></li><li><p>Master bedroom closet is like a dead zone on the Command View map.  When players enter that closet, they disappear from the command map, then reappear when they exit the closet. If I place a victim in that closet, the victim does not show on the command map until after they are rescued. This is also noted in the Command/Lobby section, since it fits well in both areas.</p></li><li><p>Doors are still really difficult to open and close, requiring multiple attempts. This isn‚Äôt any worse than it was in SAR 1.0, but we had been expecting an improvement. It‚Äôs still pretty brutal.</p></li><li><p>Basement stairs ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù - Trying to exit the basement by going up the stairs, walked through the stairs into a room that is behind the stairs (dark, could not see much). Backed up and was standing in the stairs like a ghost (walked right through). Ran out of air, exited the game.  Could not reproduce it on the next game but I‚Äôm not sure which scenario it was.</p></li><li><p>Climbed the exterior stairs to the deck outside the charlie side slider door, but could not open the door, game crashed.</p></li></ul><p /><h2 id="AdHocTestingNotes-Jan202023MilestoneBuild-Command/Lobby">Command/Lobby</h2><ul><li><p>Student stations must not launch the game before the Command station has started and the lobby is created.  Student stations that were already started will not pick up the lobby (waited for several minutes) and have to exit the application and re-launch.</p></li><li><p>If a player crashes or exits (alt-F4) during a scenario, they are unable to rejoin the scenario in progress.  Click Join, it just spins indefinitely.</p></li><li><p>Occasionally it is possible for Command to start the scenario before all players have completed the height calibration. If this happens, the uncalibrated player is unable to participate, is floating off the ground or just unable to crawl or teleport. Everyone has to exit out and start over.</p></li><li><p>Master bedroom closet is like a dead zone on the Command view map.  When players enter that closet, they disappear from the command map, then reappear when they exit the closet. If I place a victim in that closet, the victim does not show on the command map until after they are rescued. This is also noted in the Command/Lobby section, since it fits well in both areas.</p></li><li><p>Players always appear to be standing/walking in the Command view and when viewed by other teammates, even when they are crawling.</p></li><li><p>Scenario 2 - Command view map and player maps clearly show the fire in the basement bedroom, but neither of the students can see any fire or any evidence of a fire when they go to that room.  They can see each other and see the room clearly, but the fire is not visible.</p></li><li><p>Command view selects Player 1 and the map will only show Exterior (even though all players are on the 2nd floor). No option to switch to another floor. Can‚Äôt see any players.</p></li><li><p>Instructor noted that air goes way too quickly, students have to exit the sim after only 7-8 minutes on air, they can barely finish searching one floor. Coop suggested that it should take at least 10-15 minutes for them to go from a full bottle down to the yellow HUD lights (I think this happens at 2200-2000-ish) so they are using their air about twice as fast as expected.</p></li><li><p>Need rehab option to reset air and continue search</p></li><li><p>Player joins the lobby but scenario has not started yet, HUD lights go from green to yellow to red while the player is waiting for the scenario to start.</p></li><li><p>Command can only place ONE fire in the custom scenario builder, but irl a serious fire on the main floor would burn through to the second floor. Instructor wants to place another fire above the one on the main floor, but this is not permitted.</p></li><li><p>Victim icon floats wildly around the map view when the victim is being extracted, especially when the player is going up or down stairs with a victim.  They fly around like a bat and eventually reunite with the player icon when exiting the building.</p></li><li><p>Players can hear each other through the headset, but cannot hear the Command headset (this may have been a hardware issue - needs more testing)</p></li></ul><h2 id="AdHocTestingNotes-Jan202023MilestoneBuild-Multiplayer/Sync">Multiplayer/Sync</h2><ul><li><p>Player 1 opens a door - Player 2 can see Player 1 but door does not move on Player 2 view (headset and screen view). Player 2 has to open the same door (looks like Player 1 just teleported straight through the closed door).</p></li><li><p>Player 1 and 2 are searching together.  If one player moves a piece of furniture, the other player does not see it move and has to move it themselves to continue the search (if the way is blocked)</p></li><li><p>Students found the in-game view of the partner firefighter to be unpleasant and disturbing.  Adjectives used in class include ‚Äúterrifying‚Äù, ‚Äújerky‚Äù, ‚Äúhilarious‚Äù and ‚Äúlike a zombie‚Äù.  To be specific, the joints of the partner firefighter, especially the hips, knees, shoulders, and elbows, appear to move in physically impossible ways, and the hands appear to detach from the arms. Overall, this gives a kind of ragdoll effect that is really disturbing/comical.</p></li><li><p>Player 1 and 2 find a victim together - they can both see the victim and each other in their views. </p><ul><li><p>Player 1 grabs the victim, and immediately disappears from Player 2‚Äôs view (headset and screen). </p></li><li><p>Player 2 can still see the victim, but cannot see Player 1. </p></li><li><p>Player 1 can still see the victim and Player 2.</p></li><li><p>Player 2 now grabs the victim, the victim disappears. Neither of them can see the victim.  </p></li><li><p>Victim does not show as an icon on the Command view map.</p></li><li><p>Player 1 and 2 exit the building to the driveway, victim appears on the rescue mat! </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Player 1 and 2 find a victim together on the main floor in Scenario 2.</p><ul><li><p>Player 1 grabs the victim</p></li><li><p>Player 2 grabs the victim</p></li><li><p>Game crashes</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Player 1 and 2 find a victim together in Scenario 4.</p><ul><li><p>Player 1 touches the victim and immediately both Players cannot see each other.</p></li><li><p>Victim disappears for both players. No victims are present on the Command view either.</p></li><li><p>Both players are still in the game and can walk around, but cannot see each other anymore.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p />
