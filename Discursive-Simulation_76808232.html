But it will slide to the side of the module when the user proceeds. The user can anytime ask DTA for advise by clicking on it.</p><p>The emotions of DTA will play a significant role here.<strong> &lsquo;How much?' </strong>and <strong>'What?&rsquo;</strong> emotion will be used is based on each situation.</p><p><strong>Choose your own adventure:</strong></p><p>The discursive simulation for NVCI will use <strong>&quot;<span data-colorid="wiwc1j0ku2">Choose your own adventure</span>&quot; </strong>script.</p><p><br />Choose your own adventure follows the concept of <strong>&quot;If this, then that&quot;</strong> theory. The users will choose their own path by selecting the best statement that fits their condition at that moment. Based on the selection of the user, the next statement will follow. At anytime, the user can go back and take another path by selecting different option. That will change the result. They may even exit from application if they wish to discontinue at any time.</p><p><strong>How is goes?</strong></p><p>The student will be introduced to the scenario and DTA. The storyline of scenario will be presented followed by couple of questions which will be decision based on storyline. The scenario will continue in the direction of how the student responds to the question.</p><p>There are 3 paths which the scenario follows based on student&rsquo;s choice.</p><ol><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="rv22e2n05i">Ideal path</span></strong>: This is the perfect way of how situation should be handled. If the student chooses this option, the DTA will show happy emotions and give good feedback. It can be followed by next scenario.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="a8xwwgq680">Persuasive path</span></strong>: This can be good way but not perfect/ideal way of dealing with situation. The DTA will show emotions related to it and give feedback of what is expected and why. This is ideally not good way and next time the student should not be following this path. So, it follows with reattempting the situation.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="qcwy5h7vsv">Ineffective path</span></strong>: This is opposite of what ideal situation should look like. The DTA can show negative emotions (not inappropriate but emotions that represent disapproval from DTA) followed by giving student an option to again try the situation.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Scenarios:</strong></p><p>Overall, the simulation is to consist of three modules. Each module is a different scenario where students are presented with 3-5 options (called &quot;paths&quot; in NVCI training) for how they can handle the situation.</p><p /><p>Here is the meeting recording for explanation about discursive simulation/scenario.</p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><a href="attachments/76808232/76873791.mp4">SIMS  Format for NVCI-20210218_150250-Meeting Recording.mp4</a></span><p />
