This can be avoided by clicking on the Supervisor Feedback button whenever it is available on the screen .

There is nothing wrong with installing a recessed light fixture (Pot Light) in a bathroom, but that type of fixture is not compatible with the octagonal Light Box that was installed during rough-in.  The <strong>Pot Light fixture can be connected successfully, but it should hang down from the conductors</strong> (similar to the sketch of the 20&rdquo; Stainless Ventilation Fan) so that students can immediately tell that it is not possible to install it in the Light Box.  The <strong>Wall Sconce does not need to hang from the conductors, but it should be left as is (do not adjust the &ldquo;gooseneck&rdquo; part of the lamp, it is not adjustable irl) so that it is shining across the ceiling </strong>(not shining downward into the room like you would expect). </p></li></ul></li></ul></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>

We discussed this for a minute - we agree but we aren&rsquo;t sure how big of a priority this is (we aren&rsquo;t sure if it&rsquo;s something we have been trained to expect, so we expect it, or if students will actually need this type of support) This would be a disruptive change that would cost us in terms of time and risk, so we want to proceed carefully.  We plan to <strong>gather data at the student focus group by observing students</strong> to see if anyone has a difficult time figuring out what they need to do in this task.  We can also consider a toast prompt similar to the one shown when placing boxes in the scene. Instead of &ldquo;Select a location to preview&rdquo; it might say &ldquo;Select a conductor to terminate&rdquo; or something like that.  We will hold off on changes until we get more student feedback so that we can do exactly what students need.</p></li><li><p>There is a bug in the gang box where <strong>all of the previously terminated conductors are still showing while you&rsquo;re trying to work with the next set of conductors</strong>, we will fix that, it looks like spaghetti.  It is possible (likely?) that the hover highlight will not be as important for this task if it is easy to see what to click on.</p></li><li><p>Need a <strong>learner prompt in the Terminate Conductors tasks</strong> that would be similar to the one used in Mount Boxes task.  Instead of saying &ldquo;Select a location to preview&rdquo; it could say &ldquo;Select a conductor to terminate&rdquo;.  The problem is that no options or actions are immediately obvious when you go to the Terminate Conductors view in the scene - you have to select one of the conductors before you get any feedback or see any options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pigtails must be stripped </strong>at the distal end (the end that is not in the marrette connector).

In other words, treat all of the bond conductors as a single task and let the student redo that task as often as they need to.  Neutrals and Hots would be separate tasks.  If a task was completed with no errors/code violations (e.g. all 4 neutral wires terminated correctly) then we can restrict the student from redoing that task.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="CEPlayableDemoFeedbackTracking-TE-02OCT2024-CEfeedbackfrom:ChrisHarnock">02 OCT 2024 - CE feedback from: Chris Harnock</h2><p>This week, the meeting focused on demo build <a class="external-link" href="https://stuconestogacon.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/VARLab/Ebgp3jXBu7hDoY-FI1ApzYcBpuFgc_Fnlfl25jNiDyWKAg?e=swut7J" rel="nofollow">TE-24F2.0-26SEP2024.zip</a></p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-table-width="950" data-layout="default" data-local-id="a26d4d67-48f1-4d66-8971-013dfbbedfe9" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 515.0px;" /><col style="width: 435.0px;" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><th data-highlight-colour="#b3d4ff" class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Stakeholder Feedback</strong></p></th><th data-highlight-colour="#b3d4ff" class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Jira Ticket Number(s)</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><ul><li><p>Chris requested a notation when mounting boxes so students will know which box they are working with when they select a preview location.

Suggested to <strong>change this to &ldquo;Supervisor Feedback&rdquo; </strong>This is a more neutral term and will make sense in all situations.</p></li><li><p>There is a lot of text in this box, Tom feels that students will not read it.  We need to<strong> work on reducing the amount of text</strong> because essential info is being lost (e.g. review project specs)</p></li><li><p>Some other UI elements can be displayed over top of the feedback panel, making it difficult to read. The feedback should <strong>always be displayed on top of other UI elements</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Loves the per-box feedback - feels that check and X feedback is very clear and the colour choices are good.  However, both symbols are round, which would make this feedback harder to differentiate for a student with poor colour vision.  Suggested we <strong>make the check and X symbols different shapes (not both circles)</strong></p></li><li><p>It might be <strong>difficult for a student to focus</strong> in on specifically where the problems are that need their attention.  Maybe this could be done by emphasizing which boxes have mistakes, or we might consider ONLY showing feedback that requires the student&rsquo;s attention (this would be more consistent with the inspection results as well).  Something to think about.</p></li><li><p>We need a &ldquo;<strong>call to action</strong>&rdquo; in this feedback that clearly indicates to the learner what they should do about this feedback.</p></li></ul></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>

Here is a summary of some decisions made:</p><ul><li><p>It is NOT important for the student to decide which box to connect to which other box - there are multiple valid ways of doing it, and the correct/incorrect nature of each method is highly conditional (e.g. it is okay to wire the &ldquo;home run&rdquo; source cable directly to the GFCI outlet, as long as you connect it in a specific way that you wouldn&rsquo;t need to use otherwise).  This interdependency of tasks means that we will really struggle to provide meaningful and specific feedback, because it will be ambiguous if certain options are right or wrong.</p></li><li><p>The student will select which connection (between 2 boxes) that they want to make.

Sana shared some design ideas for how to show project and CEC inspection feedback, which we discussed at length.  The trick will be finding a balance in how much information we provide in the feedback - we want to help the students identify exactly what went wrong, without just giving them the correct answers.  Great discussion, and Chris loved the design ideas - probably just need a bit of refinement moving forward. Here are some points that were brought up:</p><ul><li><p>No immediate feedback - Chris does not want students to get immediate feedback, for example when they place a box in the wrong location. He wants students to get feedback at inspections, not for each task as they do it.</p></li><li><p>Specific feedback - Chris loves the 1:1 relationship between each code violation listed and the specific component that it applies to.  This means that if a student makes the same code violation 3 times, it will be listed in the inspection report 3 separate times, each time referencing the box or component that it applies to.  Likewise, if a single component violates multiple different rules, each violation will be listed separately and reference that component.  This provides really clear and actionable feedback for the student.</p></li><li><p>Helping the student understand where they went wrong - We discussed ideas like using images (even 360 scene images) to help the student visualise where boxes and devices should or shouldn&rsquo;t be installed in the scene. We talked about &ldquo;ghosting&rdquo; in fixtures such as tub, toilet, vanity and shower, to help the student understand why a location is inappropriate for this project (they could see that the outlet is behind the vanity or right beside the bathtub).  There was some concern about the implementation of dynamic photos (that would show what the student actually did) versus static &ldquo;answer key&rdquo; photos that would show the student the correct installation locations.  Katrina pointed out that students could screen-shot the &ldquo;answer&rdquo; images and share them with their friends, so maybe this isn&rsquo;t the best idea.  It was a great discussion, but no final decisions were made.  Chris clearly said NOT to add in fixtures like vanity, toilet, tub, etc in the scene right now.  I assured him that we could decide to add those in later, and that we could do some kind of on-demand display (click a button to see the ghostly fixtures for 3 seconds or whatever).  No final decision, interesting topic. We&rsquo;ll revisit.</p></li><li><p>Chris decided that for the <strong>Fan Box task</strong>, he wanted us to offer only ONE option.  This is atypical compared to other component selection tasks, but he feels this is the only appropriate way for the student to select the bathroom exhaust fan.  The correct fan is a <strong>standard 9 1/4&rdquo; by 9 3/4&rdquo; bathroom exhaust fan</strong>, so that is all that will be offered.  Chris also clarified that the fan and fan box are all parts of the same exhaust fan, and you just take it apart to install the box for rough-in.  There is no other box required - you just use the box that comes with the fan, but you have to disassemble it so that there is no motor or cover for the rough-in inspection.  When the student selects the fan, they will see ONLY the fan box in the preview and mounting animations when they select a location option.  The student won&rsquo;t need to do anything extra to disassemble the fan - we will just do that automatically when they mount the fan box in the ceiling. As always, any mounting bars or blocks that are required will automatically be shown in the animation when the student confirms the location for the fan box.  For the rough-in inspection, the student is required to securely install the fan box at the correct location and correctly terminate the supply cable in this box.  No fan motor or vent cover should be installed.  I will update the Task Options and Feedback document with this information.</p></li></ul><h2 id="CEPlayableDemoFeedbackTracking-TE-21MAR2024-CEfeedbackfrom:ChrisHarnock">21 MAR 2024 - CE feedback from: Chris Harnock</h2><p>Build <a class="external-link" href="https://stuconestogacon.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/VARLab/EQM3Dhy1nDlApYREiZNhSEIBOuwUSLIO2DHfUGjtbr-10g?e=iJxUyh" rel="nofollow">TE-24W5.1-14MAR2024.zip</a></p><div class="table-wrap"><table data-table-width="950" data-layout="default" data-local-id="8eff38bf-4dc0-4ede-b9e0-63a5027b39ef" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 515.0px;" /><col style="width: 435.0px;" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><th data-highlight-colour="#b3d4ff" class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Stakeholder Feedback</strong></p></th><th data-highlight-colour="#b3d4ff" class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Jira Ticket Number(s)</strong></p></th></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Component Placement</strong></p><ul><li><p>Looking forward to having more options to choose from in the selection panel and updated models in the scene!</p></li></ul></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>

He wants them to &ldquo;feel the impact&rdquo; of making mistakes and having to redo the work.  He WANTS them to make mistakes in the DLX, as a way of reducing mistakes in the skills lab. He also wants them to catch as many of their own mistakes as possible, as he feels this provides a meaningful learning opportunity instead of always relying on someone to tell you if your work is correct or incorrect.</p></li></ul></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p /><p>
