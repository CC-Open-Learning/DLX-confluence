</div><p /><h2 id="ConestogaOrientationResearchDocument-Overview">Overview</h2><p>This document tracks the research conducted and conclusions drawn by the team regarding potential questlines for the Campus RPG project. The research in question focuses primarily on the goals of Conestoga Orientation and determining what the “Canadian experience” entails for international students.</p><p /><h2 id="ConestogaOrientationResearchDocument-Research">Research</h2><h3 id="ConestogaOrientationResearchDocument-Conestoga101">Conestoga 101</h3><div class="table-wrap"><table data-layout="default" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 290.0px;"/><col style="width: 470.0px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Info about Conestoga</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>How it can be used</strong></p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>The College Experience</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>College is a different experience for everyone, whether they were in high school or another college. Within the game, there should be NPCs related to each of the major education related backgrounds. They can explain their frustrations or worries about the situation they’re in. Perhaps they could divulge their solutions.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Difficulty Adapting</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The major areas students struggle with is an increase in workload, challenging work and independent learning. The easiest way to include this would be in NPC conversations. Alternatively, we could have a side quest with a new student from high school that emphasizes both this point and the previous.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Senior Student Advice</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Senior students recommend to new students to attend orientation and be active and energetic. If you’re an international student, the best way to get over culture shock is to talk to people. The game has the player talk with NPCs and gain friendships through them. </p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Student Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Every student has the right to be informed, to be safe, to learn, to be heard and to appeal. The responsibilities are respect for property, facilities and college reputation, respect for persons and respect for learning and work environment. These values can be said outright through posters as well as demonstrated through dialogue interactions.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Diversity</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Naturally, as Conestoga is a school with a diverse group of students, that will be reflected within Campus RPG.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p /></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Learning</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Creating Goals</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Ideally, we will include a quest log where the player can keep track of their main and side quests. These can be the representations of long-term and short term goals (though long term is meant to be 1-5 years so it’ll need to be tweaked). There’s no built-in way to have a quest log so plugins are the likely option.</p><p>These goals would be represented through the guise of the protagonist journal. This will be to add more charm to the game as well as promote keeping a personal journal.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Time Management</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>While there won’t be any recorded time within the game, we can demonstrate time management in a side quest, where within a small space, the player must perform a variety of actions within a certain amount of moves.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Growing a Community</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Over the course of the game, the player encounters important characters destined to become their friends. These characters join the protagonists' party. The goal here is to encourage students in real life to talk with one another and grow friendships with others in their program.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Professors</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>While professors are there to do a job, you shouldn’t be afraid to approach them and ask questions, both in and out of class. There will be professors in the halls that players can talk with that will exude a positive energy.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Student Success Advisors</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>At Conestoga, they are the first contact if you don’t know where to start your college experience or you have any issues impacting your learning experience. Within game, student services could either be a side quest where you help someone reach student services or they could be a constant presence to help students through their journey of the main quest.</p><p>There are help forums available online for Student Success Services to help support student mental health.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Conestoga’s building itself is quite accessible for anyone meaning that the game world will highlight this through ramps and door buttons among others. It’s also important to reference Accessible Learning which helps students with disabilities acclimate to Conestoga.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Quiet Rooms</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Rooms specifically designed to help students focus on their work, usually found within the library. There are other rooms for holding group meetings. They will definitely be represented in the game through visuals and possibly a side quest.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>IT</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Many programs involve the use of technology and as such, it is important that students understand how to talk with IT and feel comfortable with it. A quest would help the player remember, but it seems better to contact them through instant-message rather than in a physical space. The quest could involve taking part in a chat room with a member of IT where they also tell you how to connect to the wifi.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Library</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>There is too much information about Conestoga’s library service to properly explain it within the game. However, the library will be an important location within the game’s main quest so students can find it, and understand it’s uses. This is also where we can talk about the importance of gathering and citing information.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p /></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Academic Integrity</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>5 Major Principles</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Honesty, Respect, Courage, Responsibility and Fairness. All of these values will be represented in the game through character interactions. These could be worked into an encounter during the main story where the protagonist represents these values.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Cheating</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Conestoga takes academic integrity and cheating very seriously. It’s important for new students to understand thoroughly as it can have such a negative impact on their student career. </p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Academic Integrity Incidents</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Citing and referencing omissions, improper behavior in testing situations, plagiarism, loaned work to someone else, unauthorized collaboration, contract cheating, copyright infringement, copying others' work and self-copying, unauthorized aids and assistance, misrepresentation and fraud, aiding and abetting, and unscholarly behavior. </p><p>It’s a lot of expository dialogue, the game shouldn’t have this entire wall of text explaining it, Con 101 does it well enough. Speaking with international students, it might be beneficial to focus more on the consequences and suggest places where they can get more info (alternatively if they’ve done Con 101 already, it’ll serve as a reminder.)</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p /></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Wellness</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Connections</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Campus RPG will encourage forming and maintaining connections with others to support mental wellness.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Mental Health Services</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The medical care clinic supports students and is available for appointments and consultations. This could potentially be worked into the main questline.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Mental Health Tips</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Socializing, nutrition, sleep, exercise and mindfulness are all ways to help keep yourself healthy and motivated. There can be a reoccurring character that reminds the player character of these values in a comedic way.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Safety through Mobile</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The mobile safety app allows students to contact safety services as well as receive updates on weather warning and school closures. Once again, this can be detailed through character dialogue promoting the app.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Safety Drills</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Fire Drills and Lockdown Drills happen somewhat frequently, the former rather than the latter. These are important to mention but there won’t be a scene for them.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Clubs</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Clubs are a great way to be proactive and meet new people. A side quest can involve joining a club and heading to meetings where the character meets many new people.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Scams</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>According to Con 101 there has been an increase in scams specifically targeted to international students. As these can pose a serious threat to students, there could be a side quest where the protagonist’s friend is the target of a scam and they need to work through it by talking with a member of faculty.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p /></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Community</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Online Resources</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>There are many webinars and videos available for international students to help teach them about housing info, health care insurance, expectations and processes, travel info as well as opportunities within the community. NPCs in the game will mention this.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>CSI</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>There’s a democracy to CSI, with elections being help every May. CSI, Conestoga Students Incorporated, represent the Conestoga student, there is a board of directors that hold monthly meetings to see where CSI should help next. They’re appearance in the game will be as a helpful entity throughout the school.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p /></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>MyCareer</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Advisory</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>You can speak to an advisor if you don’t believe the program you’re in is a good fit for you. This will be represented in background dialogue.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>International Student Work</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>An international student may be able to work on or off campus, to explore the option they must meet with an advisor. This too will be represented in background dialogue.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3 id="ConestogaOrientationResearchDocument-Orientation">Orientation</h3><div class="table-wrap"><table data-layout="default" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 289.0px;"/><col style="width: 469.0px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Student Ambassadors</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Student Ambassador programs allow students to connect with student leaders.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Student Engagement</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Student Engagement help students through orientation and provide other services to make the transition into college easier. They have a facebook and instagram account that offer small bits of info and allow students to keep up-to-date.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Co-Curricular Portal</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>This website holds info on all the organizations and events taking place at Conestoga. Since it is updated constantly, it isn’t worth holding the information within the game.</p><p>It also offers opportunities to get involved with communities and build leadership skills outside of class. There are even some paid leadership opportunities</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>College Availability</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Campuses open the doors at 7AM and close doors at 11PM. You can obtain an after-hours pass to stay within the building during the night. This is only available if the college isn’t completely closed.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Smoking</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>It’s obvious but there’s no smoking allowed inside the campus. There are specific spots where you are able to, like exterior hangout spots.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Security</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Security’s office is on the second floor of Doon campus right in front of the library. It’s available 24/7 and offers first aid, personal safety education, safety planning, prevention and response, conflict resolution, self-defense training, walk-safe, parking and investigate complaints among other things.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Textbooks</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Important for many programs at Conestoga with multiple ways of obtaining. Many books are available to be purchased from the book store online and ship directly home, others use                 e-Textbooks which cost less.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3 id="ConestogaOrientationResearchDocument-TheCanadianExperience">The Canadian Experience</h3><div class="table-wrap"><table data-layout="default" class="confluenceTable"><colgroup><col style="width: 291.0px;"/><col style="width: 467.0px;"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Topic </strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Explanation</strong></p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Weather</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>It’s important to know how to dress properly during the winter months. One international student got a cold because they were not properly equipped (with a strong coat, hat, or mittens)</p><p>It’s worth it to wait until after you reach Canada to purchase equipment, as it is specifically designed for Canadian winters.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Hangout Spots at Conestoga</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>It’s helpful for students to know where they can gather to relax and take time off work. Notable locations during the interview was the pond, the labs, free spaces and the CozE corner.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Academic Integrity</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>In certain countries (such as India) academic integrity isn’t enforced anywhere near as much as it is in in Canada. They weren’t reprimanded for not citing sources or using any of reference template.</p><p>There are surprises and mistakes involving how strict Turnitin is and some feel they didn’t properly understand how it worked. It’s important to show these students the consequences of poor academic integrity before they accidentally make a mistake</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Currency</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Currency is handled much more digitally in Canada than some other countries, which leads to a bit of culture shock. The idea of loading money onto a card was also foreign which is definitely something that can be addressed within the game.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Virtual Tour</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Many students want to know about the school they’re thinking of attending before arriving. This game could perfectly act as a recruitment tool for prospective students.</p></td></tr><tr><th class="confluenceTh"><p><strong>Transportation Etiquette</strong></p></th><td class="confluenceTd"><p>There are many unspoken rules of the bus that international students wouldn’t know about. Some of these include open spots for people with disabilities, or those with strollers. </p><p>There are also different rules for pedestrians, as in certain countries, jaywalking is commonplace and not nearly as dangerous as it is in Canada.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p />
