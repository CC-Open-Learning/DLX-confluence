The PHI inspects the book to ensure that the practitioner is not offering any unsafe or illegal services, such as surgical body modifications like tongue splitting or subcutaneous implants, or tattooing the eyeballs.  All pictures in this Portfolio book will be rated PG13, even though the photos are often very NSFW in real life!</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="ihys7nryk2">Autoclave Log Book</span></strong> - This is a physical book that may contain handwritten entries, test strips, and/or printed &lsquo;receipts&rsquo; from the autoclave, intended to demonstrate the maintenance and calibration status of the autoclave. Failure to produce this log book or failure to follow routine documentation practices for autoclave use/maintenance is a non-compliance.</p></li><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="dqtxmram9i">Procedure setup or walkthrough</span></strong> - NO live procedures during the inspection, but the PHI can request the practitioner to set up for a specific procedure (e.g. cartilage piercing, lobe/soft tissue piercing, tattoo) or walkthrough a specific procedure (e.g. reprocessing of sterile instruments).  We will make sure that these inspections focus strictly on the objects/equipment/supplies, with almost zero focus on the person doing the setup or procedural walkthrough.  We might just see hands, when necessary.  Actions (walkthrough) can be shown as a cutscene, finishing with a POI that can be inspected one item at a time. Procedure setup can just focus on the end result vs the process of setting up - the PHI can judge if the setup was correct by inspecting the items that have been set up.  We don&rsquo;t need to watch the supplies being added to a tray, for example, but the PHI can inspect each item once the tray is set up.</p></li></ul></td><td data-highlight-colour="var(--ds-surface, #FFFFFF)" class="confluenceTd"><p>No Jira tickets yet - we are building documentation and ideas.

Examples of specialized equipment might include tattoo machines, inks, piercing implements, etc.</p></li><li><p>Ken really enjoyed the RT Equipment Orientation and AMB &ldquo;bag explosion&rdquo; interactions, and pointed out that students in the BEPH program (as well as professional PHI&rsquo;s who may be unfamiliar with some of this equipment) could really benefit from an equipment orientation.  The goal of this activity would be to familiarise inspectors with the proper names and intended purpose of various pieces of specialised equipment.  Using the &ldquo;explode&rdquo; animation (both forward and in reverse) would demonstrate how various pieces of equipment are assembled and disassembled, so that an inspector could become familiar with all the pieces and fittings.  Everyone agreed this would be a very nice add-on to the TPI project, but it was also acknowledged that this is outside of the scope of the project charter, so we can&rsquo;t really consider it until after we have satisfied all of the charter requirements.  Great idea! We are just going to put a pin in it for now and see how things go. </p></li></ul></td><td data-highlight-colour="var(--ds-surface, #FFFFFF)" class="confluenceTd"><p /></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
