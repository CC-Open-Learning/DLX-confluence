All the gauges will make a &lsquo;full sweep&rsquo; from 0 to whatever their highest reading is. This USUALLY tells you the gauges are working properly if they make the full sweep. Some (the ones that do not require the engine to be running to read) will settle on their actual reading (like the fuel gauge that does not depend on the engine to be running) You would let them sweep, then start the engine &amp; monitor from there. In our case I would suggest returning them all to 0 anyways as the above doesn&rsquo;t necessarily serve any purpose here. </em></p><p>Oil pressure gauge: <em>When you start the engine, after a few seconds you should see a valid reading. Oil pressure is probably the most important so I always tell students to watch that one first. If the engine runs for more than about 15 seconds and it doesn&rsquo;t read it should be shut down asap &amp; further investigating required. Ask me how I know this lol.</em></p><p>Air gauge: When the engine is started, the air pressure gauge will behave as follows:</p><p>Air pressure gauge will start at zero and pop to life when the engine is started up.&nbsp; It will quickly &ldquo;sweep&rdquo; and then settle to optimal range within a couple of seconds.&nbsp;The idea is that the truck maintained air pressure while the engine was turned off, so we shouldn't see a really low reading that gradually comes up to optimal with a compressor running.&nbsp; It should look good pretty much right away, otherwise, that could indicate there is a leak in the system. Note: Compressor is silent, you will not hear it running. From John:</p><p><em>The air compressor runs constantly but silently, it is constantly building and replenishing air. The system pressure will build to approx. 100-120 psi then the blow off valve located on the bottom of the compressor will &lsquo;pop off&rsquo; and the excess air will be expelled with a loud clear audible hiss (2-3 seconds of a loud PSSSSSSS&rsquo;ing noise) dropping the air back down to optimal levels. Usually if the compressor is faulty or there is a significant audible leak, the pressure will only build to a certain level (say 40-50psi) then stabilize there it will not be able to build higher. You would almost never see an air gauge fluctuating, merely reading low although it could be a good teaching tool to include regardless. There are significant air valves within the dashboard and on occasion you will hear the air hissing back out the dashboard from the large red or yellow air buttons. The student will not hear the compressor at any point, just the sound of an air leak located almost anywhere. There is approximately 100 miles of air lines and connections running everywhere so chances are even the best maintained truck in the world will start losing air after being parked for a few hours. </em></p><p><strong><span data-colorid="b2yn80ezdb">Fuel gauge(s)</span><span data-colorid="tswwydcun7"> </span></strong>- There appear to be two external fuel tanks on the truck, one on each side of the tractor vehicle.  Do these each have a separate fuel gauge, or are they treated as if they were one big tank? <strong>From John: There is one gauge for total fuel capacity, regardless how many external tanks there are.</strong></p><p><strong><span data-colorid="b60zhax7k6">Fifth Wheel / Coupling mechanism</span></strong> - Does this need to be inspected with a trailer attached?  What is the inspection workflow when a trailer is on (because the vehicle in our simulation has a trailer on) <strong>From John: We will inspect with the trailer ON and the main point to inspect is that the trailer is securely coupled to the fifth wheel. To verify this, student will inspect that the pin handle and pin indicator are both IN (which indicates that the fifth wheel jaws are CLOSED). We can optionally include a view from under the trailer looking forward toward the cab, at that vantage point the learner can see if the fifth wheel jaws are fully closed around the trailer kingpin to verify that the trailer is securely coupled.</strong></p><div class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-information"><span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon" /><div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p>Email to John Way 29 OCT 2021 - Responses recorded above in bold</p></div></div><h2 id="ScopeRefinement-TruckingInspection-ListofitemsfromtheInspectionchecklistreferencematerialthatwillNOTbeincludedinthissim:">List of items from the Inspection checklist reference material that will NOT be included in this sim:</h2><ul><li><p><strong><span data-colorid="q0v9y5pe46">Lift gate:</span></strong> As per John, this is a feature on DZ delivery type trucks that is used for unloading by hand to a ground-level such as a parking lot.
